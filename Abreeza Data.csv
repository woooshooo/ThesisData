Bluecarrot2020	"Singapore, Singapore"	 1 week ago 	"Small, accessible location"	"Abreeza Mall is a convenient place to shop and eat when staying at Seda Hotel in JP Laurel, Davao City. It is right across the hotel. There are a number of restaurants to choose from for lunch and dinner- fastfoods, regular dine-in e.g, Japanese (Sumosan), Shakey’s, Jollibee, Yellow Cab, For snacks and coffee, you can go to Starbuck’s , J.Company , Dunkin Donuts or one of the food stalls/carts like Fruits in Ice Cream, etc. Most of the shops are those found in Manila. Foreign brands are present - Mango, Esprit, Gap, Giordano, Charles & Keith, Hush Puppies, H&M, etc. A few interesting local brands are available like Chimes, Cocoon (nice formal wear at reasonable prices), Just G (for tweens and teens), Mendez. There are gadget shops on the upper floor. There is also a Robinson’s Dept Store (poor rating for me) and a Robinson’s Supermarket (good rating for me). If you just want to stroll around, mall is ok but if you want to shop, try other malls. "
David T	"Christchurch, New Zealand"	 4 weeks ago 	Excellent 	A great mall with all kinds of products westerners are used to seeing. Very good choice of restaurants and the prices are excellent too.

Mehylander	"Morgantown, West Virginia"	" January 4, 2018 "	Clean and secure	"A little confusing to get into but it is very secure even for Grab.

When in Davao, Abreeza Mall is the best place to do this because, not only is it big and with fantastic architecture, it melds greens and open spaces into the space to cloak shoppers in an even more relaxing vibe. Tourists can also shop for locally made food products and goods at the outdoor Asian Fruit Market and at Davao Dwellings at the 3F."
Borgyliscious	"Davao City, Davao City, Philippines"	" October 5, 2016 "	Very Accessable Mall	"Just infront of Redemptorist church. Very nice mall, not that spacious compared to manila malls or even with sm lanang premier... But it serves the people well.  Places to eat? They got many... moon cake, grab a crab, etc... Depending on your food trip and budget.  Parking? Average... Did not experience the hassle of finding parking spaces here.  What I do not do here? Groceries... A bit pricey compared to Gmall and VP."

For me, it looks like an ordinary mall. On the 3rd leve; outer part of the mall there are a handful of restos and fastfood area over-looking Davao City. You can feel the cool air breeze. Situated in the ground floor level are the famous fast food chains that we see in Manila"

Leah N	"Davao City, Philippines"	" August 24, 2016 "	Worth Going To	"Together with my husband and our children on a Sunday, we went to Abreeza to dine and shop. The place is huge filled with differing shops and kiosks selling a variety of items from food to condo units. One can never ran out of stalls to visit, for both the brand conscious and those who are not. There's also a place in the ground floor area where young kids can enjoy playing without having to shell out money. The mall is clean, the area for strolling and its toilets; airconditioning system works; and the mall can easily be accessed in terms of transport."
TonyUy	"Davao City, Philippines"	" August 23, 2016 "	clean and beautiful.	"It's the best mall in Davao City in terms of cleanliness and functionality, and the cinemas are the best specially the reservation of the seat method. High end stores and quality products are here.  The only problem is that whenever there is a function or event the noise is so loud that you can't seem to get away from it, even when you are in the stores around the area and even when its distant from the event vicinity."
MANUEL D	"Davao City, Philippines"	" August 23, 2016 "	A Mall to Behold	Nothings beats an all in one place. A view of the magnificent landscape. Food places that Davao is known for. And play places for kids. Seat and relax and shop galore.

Great to either sit out or inside.   The dermatology clinic Belo is a great experience, and accomodated us even if we where late.   They offer many cash withdrawal machines (ATM's), luckily because many of them was out of order or did not serve interantional cards(?)   Even going to the toilet area is a pleasant experience. Clean, well maintained by a great staff!"
CaliTo69	Philippines	" June 5, 2016 "	Huge & Tiring	"Being an Ayala mall, the design resembles like Trinoma in Quezon City, the design is huge and somehow circular and rectangular which can make you lost or tired due to distance. Many of the stores in Abreeza are not available in Manila."

Dennies S	 	" May 21, 2016 "	Abreeza Mall The Upscale Mall in Davao	"Abreeza Mall is part of the Ayala Malls chain nationwide and if you say Ayala Malls you expect upscale high end brands for the local market.  Abreeza Mall did not disappoint the delicate taste of Davaoeños. It provided them a haven for shopping and dining pleasure. Some brands are even ahead in Abreeza than Ayala Center Cebu which is considered the shopping mecca of the south.   When in Davao, its a must to visit Abreeza Mall."
Marilou Y	 	" May 20, 2016 "	VALET AT ABREEZA	"Of the many malls in Davao City, I frequent the Abreeza mall. Aside from being accessible from home, I go there to relax, see many free activities, exhibits and shows at the atrium. Going to the movies is very convenient and hustle free because of pre assigned seats which could be bought on line or way ahead of time. Usually , when I have nothing to do after my early grocery shopping at Robinsons Supermarket at the the first floor, I while away my time choosing movies to see, order my popcorn and lemonade at TATERS to be delivered to me inside the cinema. There are also fruits in season sold at the foodcourt right besides Taters. There are many shops selling branded clothing and shoes which where once found only in Manila like Mango, M n S, Debenhaus, Dorothy Perkins, Payless, Aldo, Naturalizer, and rows of restaurants at the first, second, and third floor. My grandchildren enjoys playing at the mall covered playground, driving electric cars and riding the electric train. I have eaten in almost all the restaurants in this mall such as Antonio's, Dong Juan, Chikaan, Hukad,Somosan, Shakey's, Sunburst, Chowking, Mang Inasal, J.Co, Army Navy, The Coffee Bean, Italliannis. TGIF, to name a few. Every thursday night the mall offers free zumba class. Fully Booked and National Book Store, as well as Book on Sales are my sources of magazines and books. Abreeza has almost everything to cater our family needs. Many uniformed guards roam around to help secure the mall. These guards are approachable, polite and helpful. Their visibility around the mall makes me feel secure. In front of Robinson Dept Store is a terminal for registered buses and vans coming and going to nearby cities and towns.   There are 4 things in Abreeza that make it stand above the rest of the malls :  1. The 2 rocking chairs for the senior citizens called SILYA.  2. The use of Family Lounge free to senior citizens.   3. The many clean toilets and the free toilet papers that that seem not to run out of supply. This sprawling 3 story mall has at least 3 toilets stations ( male , female, Pwd) with many cubicles in every floor.   4. This is the only mall that has a valet service."

Brian Chester L	"Davao City, Philippines"	" April 22, 2016 "	My Frequented Mall	"I always go here to buy groceries, shop, eat out with friends/family or just relax. IMO, this is the only mall in Davao so far that has almost everything a mall rat, fashionista, tourist or businessman would like. You've got a variety of dining options here for the budget conscious, middle class or a high roller. The shops are also varied enough for every budget. One good thing about this mall is also it's open area at the top level where various restaurants with rightly priced food are located. They also have an area for kids in the atrium."

MarzDavao	"Almere, The Netherlands"	" February 18, 2016 "	Still the best mall in Davao	"With the coming of other malls like SM Lanang the competition is very high...Though smaller in sq meters for me Abreeza is still the nicest mall in Davao...Why? because the shop variety is a good mix of restaurants, clothing,shoes, and gadgets etc etc. Everything you need is in Abreeza. Also the people are more upscale then for example. It is also not that crowded."
Ralph S	"San Antonio, Texas"	" January 14, 2016 "	Another nice mall in Davao!	This mall is a little bit upscale compared to the others in town. We enjoy the good Korean Restaurant in their outdoor garden rooftop section. They also have an interesting looking tuna restaurant there which we will try next.
iamatopmodel	"Davao City, Philippines"	" January 3, 2016 "	Most malls don't have it all. Abreeza does.	Abreeza remains to be my go to mall in the city. Highend shops offer great discounts at anytime. You don't always notice them because markdowns aren't conspicuous. You gotta get in and check the price tags yourself.
majanu	"New York City, New York"	" December 27, 2015 "	good small mall	"We went to see the Star wars movie, while we were on visit to davao, only 165 peso for movie ticket and you choose your seats, wow, really liked it.

So there you have it!"

Michael L	"Davao, Davao City, Philippines"	" December 11, 2015 "	The best in Davao	"Abreeza Mall is one of the two more ""upscale"" malls in Davao and offers, at least from my point of view, the best shopping experience in the city for those interested in brand name merchandise. It's got lots of ""designer"" stores familiar in the west, including Tommy Hilfiger, Armani Exchange, the Gap, Guess, Nine West, and some others that can't be found elsewhere in the city.   The mall was built by Ayala, one of the largest developers in the Makati area of Manila and the design expertise of that group is evident in the overall attractiveness of the mall, which is a bit more interesting than the concrete boxes more typical of the mall genre in Davao. Though it's not nearly as interesting nor as sophisticated as Greenbelt in Makati--perhaps Ayala's best known shopping project--it is the most elegant experience that Davao has to offer, and it does provide a clean, attractive ambience in which to shop. Underground parking is abundant and easily accessible and all floors can be accessed via a glass elevator or escalators.   Though the mall offers a number of restaurants catering to a broad range of tastes, it does not feature any of the higher end, intimate restaurants characteristic of Greenbelt, nor does it have the green, landscaped open areas of the latter. Nonetheless, the mall is a viable, welcome addition to the city."

"Canova, South Dakota"	"Canova, South Dakota"	" November 29, 2015 "	A Nice Mall	"If you want to get all your shopping done in one place then this is a nice AC place to do so. Mall prices tend to be slightly higher than elsewhere in the city, but not prohibitively so."

chickmom	Cebu	" September 10, 2014 "	Ayala in Davao	"Ayala mall is known for its friendly design and interiors. This was my first visit to Abreeza though I have frequented SM Davao before.  Famous branded stores are here and the usual Ayala design is obvious. Their department store and grocery is Robinsons. The kids like the activity area where they are free to roam and play around while the adults take their pick in the stores nearby. As a member of VIPinoy, I was able to use their lounge for free.  I am looking forward for the a more eco-friendly mall with gardens and trees to cool off which Ayala is known for. So expect an expansion in the coming years."
?????? ?	"Bangkok, Thailand"	" September 2, 2014 "	Cool	Everything that you need is in this place.

profzulueta	"Bacolod, Philippines"	" April 12, 2014 "	Taking the mini buses from Abreeza Mall to Tagum City.	"We were travelling from Cagayan de Oro to Tagum City, Davao to participate in the 2014 Prisaa National Games. Upon arrival in Davao City, we were told to go to Abreeza Mall where the Davao Metro Shuttle buses going to Tagum have a terminal.   The first taxicab overheated right in front of the main entrance of the mall and the guard helped us load our belongings to another cab to bring us to the Davao Metro Shuttle bus which was located at the back. From Ecoland bus terminal to Abreeza Mall the meter read 130 pesos and we paid an additional 50 pesos in the new cab that brought us around to the back.  We arrived in Abreeza Mall past five pm, after an eight hour trip from Cagayan de Oro so we decided to rest first inside the mall and eat some snacks before proceeding to Tagum.  We were informed by some travellers that the mall was built by Ayala and the anchor store is Robinsons. We bought some food at the Robinsons Supermart which was huge and went malling. Being an Ayala property, the mall was well constructed and modern looking. Amenities included escalators and elevators. Airconditioning was more than ample. ATM machines were all ideally located in the different levels.   There were several high end stores and the usual fast food franchises.  After one hour we decided to proceed to the Davao Metro terminal near the Abreeza/ Robinsons Supermarket entrance but there was no bus around when we arrived and the lines were already long because office workers going home after work were starting to arrive.   After another hour the mini buses started arriving every 15 minutes. To cut the story short we finally arrived at our destination from Abreeza mall at around 9:00 PM.  Travel notes: Take the buses from Ecoland Terminal when going to Tagum from Davao City. Cost and travel time is almost the same. Less transfer hustles especially if you have luggages to carry. Davao Metro and Bachelor Express have clean and safe buses at Ecoland. You will also save on taxi fare."
Fl0ng	"Cebu City, Philippines"	" March 7, 2014 "	"Strolling, Eating and Meeting Close Friends at Abreeza"	"Before I left Davao Last year, Abreeza was about to open, everyone was so excited. Now, I promised to myself that when I got home, I have to visit Abreeza and you know what, my experience in Abreeza was unforgettable. First, I met my three closed best friends and dancers, coincidentally. Second,oh my, this mall is to the next level, they got a cool escalator, a very expensive elevator, a free charging station everywhere and washrooms are very clean. And lastly, as a consumer, first time in my life that I went to a mall, a guard opened the cab’s door for me, I was speechless, I thought I was in a five star hotel and when I was cleaning my shoes in the washroom, a janitor approached me, As he handed me his cleaning towel, he smiled and said, “kani gamita sir oh.” I was amazed. I can’t hide my reaction, I was really surprised and proud. This is my hometown and they treated me well. They had truly a very satisfying customer service. Well-Trained."

Jeremy N	"Dover, Delaware"	" July 8, 2012 "	Beautiful Mall...American Prices	Great place to visit...its a great mall and very modern and has Starbucks and TGI Fridays if you miss those places from the States :) However the prices there are inline with American prices for food and products. The movie theater is really nice and you get to pick your seat even when you get your tickets which I never saw before but the theater prices are WAY cheaper than in the USA so thats a plus! If your in Davao its a great place to stop!

Philippines	Philippines	" May 16, 2012 "	Retail therapy at ABREEZA	"The Abreeza Mall is a new and huge mall in Davao City and a one-stop haven for shoppers like me. Built on a 10-hectare land along Bajada, right across the Redemptorist Church, this Mall is a joint venture between Anflocor and Ayala Land Inc. Another beautiful Ayala Mall that reminds me of the TRINOMA in Quezon City.  I immediately bought me a tall cup of classic Starbucks caffe latte to fuel my whole day of retail therapy in Davao City. Abreeza carries elegance with its name; obviously for the high end branded shops that it houses, and the whole modern, sleek physical structure. It was newly inaugurated in 2011 and has attracted Davaoenos from all walks of life. My friends and I ate a delicious lunch at Bigby’s.I observed that there were a number of interesting restaurants in the complex , modern cinemas, a Robinson’s Department Store and Supermarket. Retail therapy to the max!!!"
