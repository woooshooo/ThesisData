"50ftqueen","Davao City, Philippines","1 week ago","Best place for South Sea Pearls","This place is the best place to buy authentic souvenirs from Mindanao. The souvenirs come from almost all tribes in Mindanao, and you can be sure that if you are nice and haggle well enough, you will get a good price for your purchases. Most of the stores here are airconditioned, but wear comfortable clothing that you can easily slip in and out of if you plan to try on clothing.  I go to Aldevinco every chance I get because of their south sea pearls. Some tips:  1. DO NOT PURCHASE PEARLS FROM THE FIRST STORE YOU VISIT. Take some time to go around to compare prices among the stores as these will vary.  2. Read up on buying pearl jewelry. Know how to spot fake pearls from real ones, and that freshwater pearls do not have the same lustre as south sea pearls, tend to be smaller and cost less.   3. Credit cards are accepted at some stores (e.g. for purchases such as pearls), but there is a 3.5-5% additional charge. For small purchases like trinkets etc., it is best to pay in cash.  4. Be nice. Haggling is an art and your charm and kindness will go far. I've been frequenting a shop for several years and the owner is kind enough to suggest and select better quality pearls for me.  5. Always remember that you get what you pay for. If you pay less for pearls, expect that you will get pearls that maybe have too many fishbites, have an uneven lustre etc. The good quality pearls have less fishbites, an even color, and are round/even in shape.  6. If you have access to a jewelry maker, purchase loose pearls instead and have them set in gold. The ready to wear earrings for sale at Aldevinco are glued or mounted on stainless steel. Bigger pearls need a solid post and a large push back to ensure that your earring stays nice and secure when you wear them.   Enjoy shopping!"
"sabi0james","Manila, Philippines","March 7, 2018","A great place to find authentic Davao/Mindanao items","Imagine a whole complex dedicated to local crafts, that's basically what Aldevinco is. Stall after stall offering local clothing, jewelry, souvenir items. There are also some money changers to help tourists doing some shopping. Located near Ateneo de Davao and Marco Polo hotel, the complex is very accessible. The night market is also located just outside the complex . So day and night this place offers something to visitors and residents as well."

It's a great place to buy pearls which I can use on a daily basis. I love it that most shops have pearl designs that are modern and youthful. I wouldn't say that this place is for everyone but it's nice to visit if you love jewelry and local goods. "

"lionlamica","Florida","November 9, 2017","Nice friendly shops","We did some shopping after my wife got out of the dentist office there. Most of the shops are full of souvenirs for the tourist looking for something about Davao, they also have some shops selling more traditional type clothing. This one shop had these wooden carved frogs that if you run this stick that comes with it across it's back it sounds like a frog. Some shops are a little pricey if your from america and some are reasonable you just need to look around or in my case my wife is from Davao so its a little harder to charge me more than the locals and my wife lets them know about that kind of stuff."

"pastelprism","Manila, Philippines","October 19, 2017","Souvenirs Galore","This is definitely a go-to place when shopping for souvenirs. Tourist shops tend to be expensive so I was having second thoughts visiting the place, but we went anyway. I was pleased to find that the prices here are low that I was able to get stuff for everyone in the family, even to my officemates. When I got to back to Manila, I found same items being sold about 200% higher than the price at Aldevinco. We got bags, shirts, malongs, pouches and wallets and even pearl earrings that we had to buy additional baggage allowance or we'd exceed as the shopping was unexpected. Just make sure you have enough cash because the shops don't accept credit cards (or at least the ones we've been to)."
"New Zealand","New Zealand","October 15, 2017","Beware of the varying prices from one store to another","This place has quite a few stores that sell souvenir items from Davao. However, it pays to go around and check the prices as they can vary from one store to another - even if it's for the same item! The layout of the stores aren't really appealing to me as they seem to squash everything they sell in tiny spaces, so there really isn't enough room to move around in. What this shopping mall (if you can really call it that) is famous for is a place to go to if you want to exchange your U.S. dollar at black market rate."

For pearls I go to Sam J's both in Aldevinco just across Marco Polo and Ateneo de Davao University. The advantage is that they give me the best price for being loyal. Maybe you can drop my name and get my discounts too! Best though to ask nearby stores for similar garments to get the best price.   My guests never leave Davao without a trip to Aldevinco! "

"Kris_ianne"," ","January 22, 2016","Good place to get money exchanged","The Aldevinco Shopping Center is right across the street from the Marco Polo hotel. It is filled with tiny shops offering batik fabrics, purses, blouses, tee shirts, hats, and jewelry. Be careful about buying pearls -- you can tell from one shop to the next that some are fake, but even the costume jewelry in American dollars is a bargain! Don't be afraid to haggle a little with the sellers....you will be tempted to buy something from everyone, because the people are so sweet. I also noticed the money changers there gave MUCH better rates than the hotel. They will give you a higher rate if you exchange large bills. Everything I bought was of good quality, but be sure to try on EVERY TEE SHIRT because the sizes run very small and will vary (I bought two tee shirts from one shop and both of them were listed the same size...but one was a good size and a half smaller than the other). Once everyone at home saw my purchases they begged for me to bring some home to them, so I have to go back and shop again tomorrow!"
"PauTheCarabao","Chiang Rai, Thailand","December 10, 2015","Thai and Chinese products Galore.","In the past - meaning before the shopping malls like SM, or Gaisano, Felcris, or NCCC took over retailing in Davao City, Aldevinco was practically the only place where you could buy souvenirs from Davao City. There were ethnic crafts like Mansaka beadwork, T'boli Tinalak, wood carvings, antiques, batik cloth from Zamboanga and many other stuff.  Today, the merchandize has been overrun by Thai and Chinese goods. There are lots of pearls being sold there. What the vendors don't tell you is that those are fresh water pearls from China. I have a problem with this because those vendors lie to you. I do NOT like being LIED to.  It is pretty much the same in other shops - including those malls. Therefore, I see no point in going there if you are only going to see the same things in other places.  Davao needs to come up with more and innovative products. They have not changed the kinds of merchandise being sold here. If you have shopped here 30 years ago, little will have changed if you visited now.  Aldevinco is a street-level shop (no second floor). It is not air-conditioned to going there on a hot-humid day will be a test of physical endurance and mental fortitude."

Aldevinco shopping center is just three blocks away from our hotel at the corner of Claveria Street and Roxas Boulevard a triangular area with more than a hundred stores.  This shopping center carries a wide variety of merchandise ranging from souvenir items, leather and weaved bags, clothing items or materials, scarf, shirts and T-shirts to carved or plain chest box (baul) to fresh or south-sea pearls.  If you are tagged as a ""tourist"" expect to be quoted 3-4x the regular selling price. This is the place to hone in ones ""haggling"" skills. Interestingly, there are more items that appeals to women shoppers. So if you are accompanying your ""significant partner"", be prepared for a long wait.  Inside the center is Dreambuck coffee shop, an air-conditioned facility where you can ""cool your heels"", read a magazine or order coffee or a light snack while waiting. (Sorry no Wi-Fi). Later carrying shopping bags will be a good exercise for your biceps at anytime of day."
"MrEdnWilbur","Luzon, Philippines","June 10, 2013","The place for ""pasalubong"" shopping.","I like Aldevinco because the batik, bags, pearls, etc. are cheaper there. Because it's a cluster of stores, the place will give shoppers a wide selection of Davao souvenir items like shirts, fridge magnets, coin purses, etc. Don't leave Davao without checking this place out."
"MijnlieverdFH","Manila, Philippines","May 5, 2013","One-stop ""Pasalubong"" Place","This was probably my third time at Aldevinco. The last time was a number of years ago. I'm not sure but there seem to be more options of stuff one can buy this time. But I was a bit sad to have not been able to find the native jewelry store I once went to.  The most common items found here are pearls (and pearl jewelry), souvenir shirts, batik, malong, ethnic crafts, souvenir trinkets like magnets and keychains, and other local items ideal for ""pasalubong."" The price is pretty okay considering these are souvenir items. But you might want to haggle first before purchasing something because the first price store salespeople give is usually much higher than the ""real"" or ""lowest"" possible retail price for the item. It is also conveniently located near other establishments. There is a market right beside it. You can buy there fruits, candies and other delicacies."
"totorohead","Jacksonville, Florida","January 29, 2013","A Shoppers Paradise","You name it, you can get everything in this place. Hold on, check that. What I meant to say is you can get batik cloths, jewelry made of pearls and gemstones, copper ware, various types of wood work, ancient swords, shields and other handicrafts. The prices are higher than expected but cheaper compared to the traveler's home country. You are. however, expected to barter and this system could be fun for others while a pain for some :) Additionally, if you run out of the local currency, they have a few money exchangers who offer better rates than banks. In closing, all I have to say is to enjoy and have fun!"
"saint28daisy","Amsterdam","December 6, 2012","Souvenirs? You can find it all here.","Many stores inside the center. You name it from shirts made out of Batik, necklaces, antiques, woven cloth, bags, other gift items and many more. Also to include money changers and snack bar and restaurant within.  You get in there and come back without buying something is impossible."
"mzzyap8","Quezon City, Philippines","October 27, 2012","Pearls! And batik! And pearls!","I stayed in Davao for only a couple of days before heading to General Santos with my family, but we made time to stop by Aldevinco for souvenirs.   Aldevinco reminded me of Greenhills and Quiapo, but a quieter, cleaner, and cooler version of the two. Salespeople also aren't as annoyingly persistent as the ones in Manila. Moving on, if you need pasalubong of the non-edible kind, drop by Aldevinco. It's near Ateneo de Davao; along Claro M. Recto Street if I'm not mistaken.   You can get all sorts of stuff here: Aladdin pants from Thailand (we call them ""Prince of Persia pants""), long printed skirts from India and elsewhere, and stuff native to Mindanao. Prices go from cheap to steep, depending on the material and quality of construction. I got a real batik skirt for Php 800, while my sister-in-law got some Aladdin pants for 1.2k a pop.   I was immediately drawn to one of the many stores selling cultured and natural pearls. My mom is crazy about pearls so I got her a necklace and bracelet set. What would ordinarily go for 1000 or more at SM, I got for 400 pesos (with a little bit of haggling hehe). Apart from pearls, you can also get accessories made from semi-precious stones and polished orange ""coral"" at prices that won't have you clutching at your chest in shock.   Aside from clothes, you can also buy furniture, dried fruit, and bits and bobs to decorate your home with.   After shopping, stop for a durian shake (if you can take the smell) at the restaraunt located in the middle of Aldevinco (forgot the name). This resto is halal, so nom away at the affordably-priced items on their menu: burgers, cake, etc. (Note: the durian shake is actually kind of nice.)  If you like pomelo and can deal with paying 500 pesos for two pieces of fruit, there are pomelo vendors just outside Aldevinco.   Tips:  This place is very wheelchair-friendly.  Even at noon, the place is nice and cool.   If you don't want to buy anything, don't make eye contact!  There's ample parking available."
"Philippines","Philippines","May 16, 2012","Colorful Aldevinco","The ALDEVINCO Shopping Center is a famous landmark in Davao City, located in a big commercial complex at the junction of Claro M. Recto Avenue and Manuel Roxas Boulevard. In my youth, we called it “ALDEVINCO” and it was our hang-out after school (nearby is the Ateneo U).  After 46 years, ALDEVINCO still is a premiere shopping destination in Downtown, Davao City; where locals, balikbayans, and foreigners shop for “ pasalubongs” (souvenirs) to take home. It proudly showcases Mindanao’s heritage and culture, through its antiques and indigenous handicrafts. There are numerous colorful souvenir items that will keep your eyes and mind entertained. I especially love the Batik products (clothes & accessories), and the native Maranao and T’boli handicrafts and jewelries. Of course, the ubiquitous “made in China” wares are around….and a handful of Southeast Asian products as well. Note please that all these products are negotiable, especially when buying wholesale. It pays to speak the dialect (Bisayan, Tagalog) but the Filipinos are adept in English, so foreign tourists will not have a difficult time haggling for a good price You can also buy fresh fruits and the famous sweet Davao “suha” or pomelos and the exotic looking durian, marang, mangosteen, and rambutan. HAPPY SHOPPING AT ALDEVINCO!!"
"redhotchili09","Manila","November 30, 2011","Davao souvenirs","What I like about this place is that a lot of its products are local [though not necessarily from just Davao but Mindanao in general]. I love getting my sarongs for use at the beach there. I like the designs because they are unique. Some stalls also sell traditional cloths and clothing although a lot of them already come from neighboring countries such as Indonesia [since Indonesian clothing and those of Muslim Mindanao have similarities].   They also have small boxes which can be used as jewelry boxes that are inlaid with mother of pearls though these are not from Davao but from neighboring Muslim provinces in Mindanao.   What I don't like about this place, however, is that Indonesian products are often passed off as local ones so you have to be careful about this.   Aldevinco is very accessible and is near Ateneo de Davao and Marco Polo Hotel."
