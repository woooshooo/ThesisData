"Mary Armi M"," ","March 17, 2018","Small but Interesting","I have been so afraid of butterflies before but this place has a lot of friendly butterflies. They just come to you. It's so small but interesting."
"Acid P","Tagum City, Philippines","March 16, 2018","Weekend Get-away","All about butterflies, they have different pictures and also information about butterflies, different species etc. They also have this butterfly garden in which you can see different colors/kinds of butterflies. Great way to educate children and just near Crocodile Park."
"RheivenRei"," ","August 26, 2017","Be with a Butterfly","Awesome tour!! Their personnels are accommodating, they are provide explanation and information about different butterflies. Good for children to learn and be connected to nature."
"Arnold and Dian... H","Phnom Penh, Cambodia","August 24, 2017","Small but beautiful butterflies","There were lots butterflies to see but only about four different kinds. We had a couple of them land on us too. The entry price was included in the Crocodile Farm and is just a walk down the road from it. You do see that the Butterfly Farm is surrounded by a cock-fighting place. The beauty of the butterflies is worth a look however you won't need to spend more than thirty minutes looking around."
"Norm H","Las Vegas, Nevada","May 10, 2017","Walk among butterflies","A simple garden, closed off with netting, with lots of butterflies flying around. Spend a few minutes just walking around watching. Can't do this every day..."
"HanaCarrera","Pangasinan, Philippines","April 17, 2017","Seedy little place-- but the pretty butterflies all made up for it!","The entrance to the Butterfly House (located 300 meters from the Crocodile Park) is included with the ticket to Crocodile Park (Php 250). The place is small and looks old and run-down with uncaring staff. There were posters about the life cycle of the butterfly but no one was employed to explain.  My sister and I both started to feel as if we've been ripped off but that mindset changed when we moved to the Butterfly garden itself. Quiet and serene, with lots of shade and benches, we watched in awe as swarms and swarms of butterflies whizzed past us from all directions. Beautiful!  In summary, you could easily spend 5-10 minutes in this place. Yes, the butterflies are beautiful but I won't go back unless they improve it."
"jedainz","Davao City, Philippines","October 19, 2016","Very few butterflies. Not well kept.","I didn't see a lot of butterflies. The place needs improvement. Maybe add and educational tour or what? Nothing special."
"MrAngry50","Oman","October 7, 2016","Flutter by any time.","No real welcome at the door, occupant more interested in sticking his pupae to a string. Very rundown, lacks any sort of clean, or investment. There are exhibits which are fascinating, shame they are incarcerated in such a place, probably better to let them free."
"meomunbeou","Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam","September 15, 2016","It's a joke","It's just a joke. A small garden house with some butterflies. The garden looks ugly with some trees and unknown flowers. Just took 5 minutes to discover."
"New Taipei, Taiwan","New Taipei, Taiwan","August 13, 2016","Interesting take on butterflies","Although the species of butterfly are lesser than what I expected but the guide was very humorous and made mundane stuffs sound interesting. They even helped us take pictures that made us feel like we are ""human butterflies"". Had fun!"
"Constantin106","Constanta, Romania","June 14, 2016","Expecting more!","Far to be a so called ""butterfly house""! Few butterflies only in a restricted area, few larvae exposed on a panel, and that's it! No butterflies, no guide, no house!"
"Eri W"," ","April 15, 2016","So many butterflies ♥","In this area, you can observe their actions very close. You can also take photographs so this place is nice for photographers that love to capture little creatures and to those people that are very interested for the life of butterflies."

"ColinG1960","Melbourne, Australia","September 13, 2015","Amazingly informative and helpful","It is a small affair but the staff there are very dedicated to their work and love telling you about all the insects they have there - including the Scorpions. Worth a visit."
"Davao City","Davao City","July 15, 2015","Educational","At the Davao Butterfly House, we learned about how these insects metamorphoses from thorny caterpillars to beautiful creatures of nature. The staff helped us get to know each stage. Live colorful butterflies fly around the garden, making learning more experiential."

"GBAINC","Kabul, Afghanistan","June 20, 2015","Disappointing","While we were going to Crocodile Park, the taxi driver told us about Butterfly House.

"Murphy-Hagunos","Kuala Lumpur","February 23, 2015","Small, But Worth a Look","My rating was a 3, but that does not mean do not go. Your P200 ticket is good for 3 attractions: 1 Davao Butterfly House; 2 Davao Crocodile Park; 3 Tribu K' Mindanawan Cultural Village. So, definitely go, and take in all three attractions. It...More"
"MijnlieverdFH","Amsterdam","January 18, 2015","Was not the best time when we visited","It was a butterfly house but less butterflies around. Maybe not the best time to make it into adult. Some other butterfly houses were so big and much flying around but not this one. Could be better next time if it is well attended to."
"AsanSiDiwaAtShiela"," ","January 10, 2015","Waste of money","There's scarcity of butterflies already in the garden. The entrance fee is not reasonable for a place they call butterfly garden with only about 10-15 butterflies flying around (or less)."
"Xanerin","Alice Springs, Australia","November 12, 2014","Not Worth Visiting","A small butterfly house with not much happening i'm afraid. Think I have been spoilt by the many butterfly houses in Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. There is an old playground outside for the children, but even that needs a lick of paint.

"lani g","Surigao","April 21, 2014","Just butterflies..","I expected a lot that's why I feel quite disappointed with the place. Though I love to see the butterflies flying around you, but the place isn't so attractive. I thought I will see butterflies around a beautiful garden, but the plants weren't taken care of properly. It's quite dry. It supposedly add to the view. "
"Quezon City, Philippines","Quezon City, Philippines","September 6, 2013","Butterfly and nature","This is just a side trip and normally come free when you go Crocodile park. This is definitely not that enjoyable experience but it should be fun when you are fanciful of butterflies, botany and stuff."
