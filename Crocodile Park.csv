"defyeo","Davao City","1 week ago","A must visit in Davao","If you want to experience interactive activities with exotic animals this is is the perfect place for you.   You get to experience feeding the tiger, ostrich, koi and crocodiles. Even as an adult you will really enjoy this place. They also have a thrilling crocodile acrobat show and amusing bird show.   This place is a must visit in Davao. I find this place even more entertaining than zoos in other countries. "
"Karen N"," ","1 week ago","Good for children","Better to go here during weekends so you can watch the Tribu perform at 6pm. There are different shows everyday. There's a petting zoo, fish feeding, ostrich feeding, etc."

"Amani C","Caloocan, Philippines","March 1, 2018","THE zoo!","Home of the famous ""Pangil"", a 18ft saltwater crocodile, which is now the biggest crocodile in captivity in the country after Lolong died. Aside from the crocodiles, you can see other rare animals which even I saw them for the first time. They also have feeding spots in some areas where you can interact with the animals. Check the shows before going there so you can watch them for free like the dancing crocodiles show and actual feeding time of Pangil."

"Simone S"," ","February 19, 2018","Sad...","The place is decadent. There is a giant crocodile in a small pool: I believe the animal even can move itself as the place is almost of its size. The smell is not good around the animals and lots of places are not well maintained (no animals inside, no information about the animals etc). I was sad there. Couldn’t enjoy. Poor animals... maybe the authorities should visit there and check if they are respecting the minimum principles to keep the animals there. "

"RaffySun61","Makati, Philippines","November 12, 2017","Must See For Animal Lovers","We enjoyed this visit. Lots of crocodiles and you get to feed them. You have to buy the feeds, which are way overpriced but hey they need to make a profit, and you get to feed the crocs. They also have tigers and other wildlife.  I didn't give it an excellent rating cause they really need to clean up a bit and the staff are not that friendly and accommodating. They seemed bored and irritated. Go during the weekends for their show."

"lionlamica","Florida","November 3, 2017","Don't miss the fire show and the big crocodiles.","This is the 2nd time I have been there, and this time I can see they have made alot of improvements. The animal show was good just watch out for the birds flying around, my daughter almost had a sea eagle fly into her. They have them flying back and forth to the trainers during the show also other birds do the same thing. There are many animals to see like lions,tigers which you can get up on the cat walk and watch the trainers feed them, also monkeys,philippine deer, big snakes, and a lot of strange looking birds. You can also hand feed the koi in this big pond they have but don't get to close because they just about come out of the water to get the food and there are hundreds of them. You can hold a croc or a big snake and take your picture if you feel like it. They also have a show with this huge croc, if you go stand up in front of his head because when he was turning back and fourth the people in the back by his tail were getting soaked from his thrashing around. The last thing you must see if you go is the fire show which start around dusk and is really awesome."

"Mandaluyong, Philippines","Mandaluyong, Philippines","August 29, 2017","Unforgettable visit to Croco Park","My boyfriend and I went here via cab, luckily, cab drivers in Davao doesn't say no! :D The park is inside a huge place, consisting of subdivision, making commute quite a challenge, as sometimes, you have to wait long for cabs to arrive. The park has an entrance fee of 250 PHP per head, (300 PHP when you arrive 2PM onwards) and you can re-enter as many times during your visit. The restaurant is outside (Riverwalk Exotic Grill) and serves good food and has a nice cultural show on weekends. I tasted the crocodile ice cream, which is made out of crocodiles' unhatched eggs and flavorings (Durian or Chocolate). Crocodile meat is also good and is a must-try when you visit the place."
"Aleksander A"," ","August 24, 2017","A fun park","I have been to Crocodile Park several times before, so it's nice to see that the park is developing. They have a whole range of animals in this park, obviously crocodiles, tigers, various types of birds, snakes, monkeys and turtles. They offer feeding of crocodiles (which I tried, I can recommend it), snake massage and other various animal shows. You can get real close to the animals, which is great if you like to take pictures, I even managed to sit right next to a giant turtle. The park is located out of the busy city core, so you need to ride a taxi to get there. There is restaurants and other small shops outside the park, so it's easy to get a descent meal and refreshments. If you're a traveling family I can recommend this park, I am sure your kids will have a great time there. And yes you can have a crocodile burger if that's your thing. "

The reptile enclosures need cleaning as does most of the zoo. The zoo looks like it is in need of a facelift. The staff are friendly and seem to interact gently with the animals. You can feed chicken bits to tiger from above them. Just remember to think third world."

"tianneXtianne"," ","July 30, 2017","Fun and educational","This place has lots of animals but i think this park has seen better days. We visited the park on a friday and paid the weekend rate but the tour, although educational, seemed to be rushed. Some advertised animal shows did not happen (like the crocodile wrangler one) so i was kinda disappointed. But i liked the koi feeding and taking pictures with the statue of a giant crocodile. Overall i think it's fun to have kids enjoy this educational trip and for all visitors to learn a thing or two about animal and nature conservation."

There are many sizes of them and it is a real experience that you can get so near to them. A little foul smell but you can ignore it if you concentrate on the reptiles rather than the area"
"Zoe P"," ","July 19, 2017","Caged!","I've never liked the idea of caged animals. Well according to their manager they are a croc farm above all. And indeed they had hundreds if not thousands of crocs. All kinds, baby crocs, sea crocs, giant crocs, medium sized crocs, croc skin wallet, a few birds and there that were saved from poachers. It didn't have that zoo vibe to it, if you like feeding tigersand crocs this is the place for you, just not for me. "

"jonsapon121"," ","July 12, 2017","Ok ","We did see many crocodiles. Really I would call it a mini zoo. We did enjoy seeing all the animals. Having lunch there was the typical food not available on the menu with it being a crocodile zoo and it being on the menu, I thought I'd try it. Then let down not available. The shops in the park should put prices on all products, I felt like we where getting tourist prices. "
"Anne P"," ","July 5, 2017","Great place but fee is pricey","Lesson learned - You have to allot at least half or more of your day to maximize the use of the Php 300 entrance fee. The place also lack of signs on how you will go around the park. We missed the butterfly garden because there is no direction how to go there or information that it is only open until 5PM. The program in the afternoon is entertaining though."

"Don R"," ","June 22, 2017","Just right","I guess for security purposes there's Too much net on the cages to prevent visitors from feeding them but you can barely see the details of the animals. A barricade would have been better. Apart from that the place is ideal for group tours. They have tigers, birds, ostrich, turtles, reptiles, snakes, etc... I also like the feeding hours wherein visitors get the chance to experience how is it like to feed crocodiles and see them jump out of the water to grab the food."

"MoriMike","Riyadh, Saudi Arabia","March 19, 2017","Educational Trip even for the Young Once!","Visited the place with friends. Also good for students on educational trips.  The park is mostly packed out with people in the afternoon. If you don’t want, go there in the morning which we did. But we stayed until later in the afternoon because I was waiting for an animal show inside the park and cultural show located beside the park. But I got tired from walking and wasn’t able to wait for the shows. So we left.  There are some crocodile quarters which are really crowded and some are not. But it’s not only crocodile you can see there. Lots of animals too! You have to buy food for the animals in order for them to move. We bought fish food for the koi’s. We feed them. Really weird the koi’s eating in your hand and exciting too! I really pity the tiger which is housed in a fitted cage. The tiger cannot move comfortably even.   There are souvenir shops and restaurants on the other side which serves crocodile sisig and crocodile lechon (which both aren’t available at that time) so we settled for crocodile ice cream instead. Taste like pistaschio ice cream and you can eat bits of nuts (but it’s not nuts) which I think is the crunchy crocodile. My friend was figuring out his ice cream when he suddenly spit crocodile skin and there are some scales included. Must try… Yummy!"

It's basically a zoo. Ticket price was 250 each and that would include entry to the croc park, tribuhan, and butterfly garden. The place is very nice, there are a lot of trees so even if you are there in the middle of the day, it is shady.

"costelmihaila80","Vancouver, Canada","February 28, 2017","Kind of wild that show with crocodiles","That show too hang a piece of meat and the crocodile ""dances"" is so wild. Every creature if hungry would act as in instinct to eat. Just as a cat tries to catch something that hopes to get in their mouths at the end of the day.Look back at the history and see how other nations took advantage of hungry people in prisoners camp and then think if is fair to laugh when a creature that is captive fighting for its food! Second, that fire show is very nice.Good job!  But the restaurant above just take advantage of the tourist attractions and adds fees and the price is just like talking advanced of your hunger so ad the crocodiles does an effort and ""dances "" then you too must ""dance "" in your wallet.If service would be good and nice smiling faces that asks you if anything is OK, time to time, then...I'll dance , otherwise, no way to get back there."

There was a mini zoo, with animals I have only seen for the first time and names of which I don't even remember (haha, so that may not make this a good review, right? LOL!)  Anyway, there is an area here where you can feed the fish, an ostrich, or a tiger. I fed the fish, haha!   There is a souvenir shop that sells souvenirs from Php 50 (ref magnets, key chains, and the like) up to Php 2,000+ (croc skin thingies). Yes, I got a ref magnet ;)  Just outside the shop, there are food kiosks, so no need to worry about getting starved. I went straight to the Croc Egg Ice Cream Shop. I dd not know what to expect from a 90-peso croc egg ice cream... but I sure don't regret getting one. It's different in that is is more ""malinamnam"" than the regular ice cream.

The cages of the tigers are very small! Hope they do something about that. Tigers should have a HUGE open space for them. The bats were a bonus for us as we never get to see bats in any animal parks.

This can be done elsewhere like they do in Boracay.  For educational purposes alright but the space where all the animals are on exhibit should be wider and spacious.

We arrived around 2:30pm so our time concentrated mostly at crocodile park.  There are a lot of animals to see and things to do like fish, ostrich and tiger feeding. The show which started at 4 was also fun. the show ended around 5pm which gave you time to look at the shops on your way to TrIbu Kamindanawan.

It is poorly managed and the ethos sickens me.","While I was there I may have looked like a happy tourist but I can assure you I was far from it. I saw wounded crocodiles (though their size impressed me) as they are in a space too small for them all and were clearly fighting. Birds in chains, rainforest animals in enclosures with no stimulation, metal bars and concrete floors, overcrowded tiger enclosure (when a tiger is a naturally solitary creature), no privacy for the animals, and the worst for me watching an orangutan collapsing all over her cage on the hard concrete, still on display, coming around from drugs administered. They allow you to hold the reptiles but don't encourage you to disinfect your hands after. They should have a gel. This could potentially lead to salmonella if not careful. I am not sure of the risk, but still a disinfectant should be used. They also had a lot of crocodile leather etc for sale. Yet they call themselves conservationists???!!! This place was originally a crocodile farm, but obviously adding more animals (which they continue to buy) made an attraction. The fish pond is overstocked with koi carp and the water is filthy. The parrots look miserable and are in chains with no privacy.  So yes basically please don't go here and add your voice to enforce positive change on this hell hole or to close it down!"

Feeding the ostrich was quite an experience, seeing a huge animal approaching you and feeding on your hand is little frightening at the beginning.  There is an animal show. Too bad the seats are not enough to accommodate everyone. But it was enjoyable and educational.  There is an ice cream store outside the park. We tried a crocodile ice cream and it has crocodile egg; it has similar taste with regular ice cream.  The fire show is also okay.   I recommend this place especially for families and kids."

When we arrived at the place, I was surprised by the cleanliness and the proper layout of the entire facility. Each crocodile cage were properly labeled and arranged. Arranged according to the size of the crocodiles (i.e. the biggest crocodile was placed near the entrance, etc). Another thing, the natural smell of the animals (crocodiles, tigers, etc.) were not so overpowering, meaning to say, the cages are being maintained and cleaned regularly. Special mentioned is their koi pond, my nephew had a blast feeding these adorable fishes.  But all is not perfect, obviously, they need to make bigger cages for the tigers so that they can freely roam. You know, small cages are stressful for the tigers. Improve their canteen and souvenir shop.  Overall, this is a good place to bring the kids and the whole family for relaxing and learning."

As expected, the park is jam packed with students who were on their excursion. The last time that I visited the park was way back in the 90's ( i know. i haven't got enough time to roam around :D ) my 3 year old son enjoyed the show and he got so fascinated with all the crocodiles that he saw ( he just got disappointed when he didn't see any cheetahs . LOL! ). The park opens at 8 AM. Adult entrance fee is 200 pesos and child entrance fee is 100 pesos. There is also a souvenir shop just on the right side when you are about to exit the park. They have strollers for rent for children which could range from 60pesos-100pesos (if i am not mistaken) just right at the entrance.  We just did not stay that long on the crocs area coz of the stinky smell, so as on the area where the monkeys are. We could not stand it. The ice cream that they are selling just right outside, near the exit area is superb. it tastes good that you have to try it, it is 60 pesos for 2 scoops of the ice cream. Part of the tour is the butterfly sanctuary(i think that is what it is called). You have to walk a distance though to get there, or it would be better if you bring with you your car for it to be much more easier for you to get there.. there were just a number of butterflies,not like before.

However, the Butterfly farm consisted of one pen with one species of butterfies and we were told the fire show was only on weekends.

"robmaghinang","Valenzuela, Philippines","September 14, 2015","One of the best zoos in the country.","The Davao Crocodile Park is a huge complex where souvenir shops, restaurants and tours are offered (such as the Davao Wildwater Adventure). There is a good amount of different animals inside and you can even take of pictures with them for a minimal fee of Php 40 (US$ 0.86). Those animals include a yellow boa constrictor, parrots, Brahiny kite, iguana and, though I haven't seen myself, a baby croc. Here's my other observations:  The upside:  1. Well-maintained and clean unlike the Crocodile Farm in Puerto Princessa, Palawan. 2. Plenty of animals.  3. Easily accessible from the city center. Don't be fooled by the distance. Take a jeep from downtown to St. Peter's Parish in Maa (pls confirm this to the locals, I tend to forget things a lot) then a motorcycle to the complex. Total ride wouldn't take more than 30 minutes.  4. A few food center are inside but souvenir shops are few and don't offer a lot.  5. Animal show is very entertaining and hosted by a great animal enthusiast.  6. Countryside and adventure tours are offered inside which may save you time.   The downside:  1. Entrance fee of Php 200 (US$ 4.28) is a bit more than other zoos in the country but still worth it.  2. As far as I am aware of, the animal show (called the Animals Got Talent) is only shown around 4pm and none in the morning.  3. Restrooms, though smells disinfected a lot, already seen its prime days.  The Davao Crocodile Park is definitely a must-see for tourists and locals alike. It was well-maintained unlike some of the parks that I have seen myself and was never boring. It is an added plus that I got a complimentary pass after I signed up for the Davao Wildwater Adventure and the Tribu K' Mindanawan and its Kaonanan restaurant."

What set this apart from other crocodile farms is that the park is designed for freestyle walk in the park type of tour. I find it favorable to have no tour guide to tail for (though some may find it unworthy to gain no knowledge of the evolution of crocs, so to speak), that you have unlimited time in the area, that you have plenty of things to do and creatures to see beyond crocs.   But there must at least be some orientation about the crocodile culture."
"Brisflip","Brisbane","August 10, 2015","Not Good","Visited the Davao Crocodile park last week. To say I was disappointed is an understatement. The animals all were confined to dirty small enclosures or pens. To give an example, the tiger was confined to a cage fifteen feet by ten feet. All he could do was pace up and down. The main attraction being crocodiles, yes there were plenty of all ages but the pens were not well maintained and smelled. The other support animals all looked to be in a fair state. The maintenance of the attraction really let the park down. For the admission price of $200 pesos you would think that everything was included...not. The ostrich attraction is additional pesos and the ostriches look like half plucked chickens.... Not happy. If this was in Australia I would have reported the park to the Animal Protection Society. "
"tiger_downunder","Brisbane, Australia","August 9, 2015","Not really appreciates me most!","Some animals were poorly maintained. The biggest croc has tiny enclosure. Tiger pen is not maintained and the tiger's pool water is filthy. Poor tiger remained inside the cage just walking around. Birds with no feathers and ostriches looks like dressed chickens. It's the only zoo-like place in Davao for locals to visit with few animals. "

Small grumble for an entertaining show. All round, it's a very enjoyable way for a family to spend the afternoon and early evening. Arrive for around 3.30 as the shows start at 4pm, and it's beginning to cool by then."

"Murphy-Hagunos","Kuala Lumpur","February 22, 2015","Much More than Just Crocodiles","If you simply do not like zoos, then you won't like this park. A small potion of it is very zoo-like, with tigers and snakes in small enclosures. But that is only a tiny portion of this park, and even those enclosures look clean and well cared for.   Other areas of the park allow lots of room for the animals to roam. And many animals there are. The reptilian creatures here include fresh- & salt-water crocks, turtles, iguanas, and snakes (mostly pythons). There is also a wide variety of other creatures -- mostly birds -- and Butterfly House, and Tribu K' Mindanawan Cultural Village are right next door. In fact, your P200 ticket is good for all three locations.   There are several decent eateries on the grounds, including a restaurant right in the Cultural Village. The washrooms are clean, as are the grounds in general, and the staff are friendly and helpful. There are the expected souvenir shops, and some nice stalls outside selling a number of ethnic items.   There are many different shows running throughout the day, but it would be wise to check the showtimes online BEFORE you go. We went from about 10 until 1:00 p.m.; however, two of the shows we'd like to have seen were on at 4 and 5:00 o'clock.   The crocs are easy to view from a raised walkway; so, you don't have to look through the cage, and you can snap some nice photos. The same kind of thing is true of the other shows too. You can take unobstructed photos of the performing animals. For P40 you can have your picture taken with an iguana or a colourful bird in your arms.   The butterfly area is smaller than others that I have been to, and there is not a huge variety. But you can get right up close for interesting and colourful photos. Walking from the Croc park to the Butterfly house, you walk by a number of very social ostriches, very shaggy sheep of some sort, and a huge number of game-birds.   The outing was definitely worth the time spent at the 3 attractions, both for children and adults. And although it was not spectacular, we will go back for another visit to take in a couple of those shows that we missed."

It's a small park that isn't well maintained. The crocodile habitat seemed fine. But the condition of the cages for most of the other animals seem too small or too neglected. I also felt sad seeing birds chained to a perch.  I went on a Wednesday afternoon and there weren't much people there. That means, getting out can involve a long wait for a taxi. I had to wait about 30 minutes. There aren't even guys on motobikes for hire.  It seems this area will eventually develop into some sort of tourism complex where many attractions can be found in one place. In addition to the crocodile park, there’s an area for a boating adventure and a butterfly park. There's plenty of empty acres for more attractions. So once this area gets more built-up with other things to do, it may be worth a visit to come out to this park.  The most interesting part of my visit did not involve the park. It was when I left the park on taxi and drove south on the main highway through Ma-a. The area felt provincial and yet, the standard of living seem much higher compared to rest of provincial Philippines. There were nice schools, churches and businesses lining the highway. It made me want to stop and take some photos."

"Tj L","Manila","May 2, 2014","Park is OK; Butterfly House is a waste of time","We got here on a really hot Sunday afternoon just before 3 o'clock because info from blogs and websites say the first show starts at 3:15 pm and we were hoping not to miss any. But it was 3:30 pm and still no show has started, and we already toured the whole place, had a picture with the yellow snake and the little croc. Thirsty and hungry, we went back to the area near the entrance because there was a burger kiosk there selling croc meat and ostrich meat burger. But they conveniently ran out of croc meat and no bun so no ostrich burger, either. So we ventured in towards area with pasalubong stores but failed to obtain crocodile ice cream and civet coffee (no stock).   It was nearing 4pm and still no show, so we decided to go to the Butterfly House. The staff we asked for directions told us it was ""walking distance lang, mam."" He must have been with Moses during the Exodus, because the distance from the main park to the Butterfly House was walking distance of biblical proportions. And when we got there, well, let me say that the Butterfly House itself was smaller than my mother's shoe closet and we finished 'touring' the place in under 3 minutes.  When we got back to the main park, the show has already started with some cockatoo playing basketball. We didn't stick around for the other shows because we were already tired, hot, thirsty and hungry. We will just watch the shows on Youtube. We'd probably go back there the next time we visit Davao, but maybe after 5 pm and on December when the weather is significantly less hot and humid.  Tips for people who want to visit the park: Bring water, don't lose your other tickets (you will be given 3 stubs - one for the main park, one for the tribu k'mindanawan, and the other for the Butterfly House), and go there after 4 PM. Transpo is not a problem as there are a lot of cabs hanging about, and the staff will call for more cabs for visitors who haven't got private transpo. But there is no transpo going to the Butterfly House (croc-drawn carts, anyone?) so you'll def have to walk.  All in all our visit was a bust mainly because of non-animal related issues. They had lots of other animals (mostly reptiles and birds and 2 tigers) not just crocodiles. Other than the animals, you can go to the Riverside grill/cafe where they serve crocodile- and ostrich-based and normal-animal food (like sisig, steak, etc.). Entrance fee of Php 200 seemed expensive. And don't go to the Butterfly House - avoid it like the plague."

I wouldn’t recommend Crocodile Park","We visited Crocodile Park on December 26th and it was appalling seeing the way the animals are kept.  I'm always shocked by the way most Asian places keep their animals which are often beyond the proper conditions, especially space-wise. It would be like keeping people in a 3x3 cell without a chance of going out to the yard ever in their lives.  Indeed it's true what's been said: Crocodile Park has more animals than only crocodiles. Nevertheless, the conditions they are kept are terrible. Most of the birds are locked inside cages they cannot spread their wings and the tiger's exercise area is not enough for a human being to practice jogging – much less a tiger. The giant crocodile was kept in a pound only a little bigger than its own body. I believe the park should either expand the area the animals are kept and the aviary should be way larger. The tigers should have enough space for their exercise and the crocodiles should be kept on better conditions – people should know that only feeding and cleaning is not enough."

"shankaronline","dubai","June 20, 2013","Average, but the tribal fire dance is a must see!","Although it's called a crocodile park, you see several other animals there, like ostriches, Bengal tiger, parrots, binturong, Philippine brown deer etc., most of which are in distressingly small cages, barring the ostriches, which have a fairly large running area. It's tragic to see the three tigers confined to a tiny enclosure, though some of the staff were trying to invite visitors (for a price) to climb onto a ramp for a 'view from top' of the tiger enclosure, though there were very few takers. The crocs themselves seem to fade into the background in view of all the other activities going on around the park. One of them is rather huge. One thrilling feature is a couple of Filipino chaps doing tricks on a tight rope right above a tank full of dangerous, large crocs. Apart from 'standing on one leg' and dances performed on the tight rope, to the accompaniment of recorded disco music, the chaps drew several gasps from a shocked audience when they pretended to slip and fall into the tank. It gets bloody crowded around the show though, so get to the show early and get places right in front. Small pavilion like stepped seating is also around, but it's pretty much useless with the hundreds standing and crowding about in front. Behind this pavilion are several enclosures housing scores of crocodiles. The best part of the croc park however is the tribal fire dance performed by professional dancers in costume. These are apparently traditional folk dances performed by the Tribu K Mindanawan tribals. The many dangerous stunts they perform with fully lighted kerosene torches and fire frames will leave you spell bound for several tense minutes! There are photo ops apelnty after the show as the dancers allow you to take pictures with them while they are still holding their burning torches. Only ignore the kerosene fumes and the smoke! All restaurants in the park serve crocodile sisig, a stew like local filipino dish made with croc meat. Fairly tasty."

There's also a fire dance show at the Tribu K'Mindanawan Cultural Village (which we enjoyed immensely), just a few steps away from the Crocodile Park.   It's best to arrive at the place 2pm or 3pm on a weekend. Have a look around the zoo first, check out their Butterfly House. The bird, crocodile and tightrope walking shows start at 4pm. The awesome fire dance show starts at 5:45pm.

On the way to the park, you’ll pass by a zorv ball site which is also open to the public for a fee. It’s similar to the zorb ride in Dahilayan Park, Bukidnon, where you ride the zorb ball that’s to be pushed downhill. I guess your hands and feet are also strapped into the zorb ball’s interior as you do the ride.  Entrance to Crocodile Park is P 150.00 per person on a weekday and P300.00 per person on weekends. Don’t be misled by the name of the park, the park is actually a zoo which houses almost all types of animals, but the main attraction are the crocodiles. Expect that most visitors are families and schools on educational trips. One thing that I can say about the park is that it’s clean and well-maintained. You can go in and out of the park as long as you have your hand stamped at the entrance gate. Policemen/ security personnel are also visible to maintain peace in order. I’m not a big fan of zoos, though."

The entrance fee was P200 from 2 pm onwards. Inside were different types of animals, and not just crocodiles.   At 4:00 pm, there was an eco-show wherein they sort of paraded the animals that were considered the main attractions of the park. This was not simply a show where they made the animals perform, but it was informative that it included how to identify the animals, how to take care of them, and how they are continuously being threatened by the society's unreserved invasion of their shelters. They consider the animals as ambassadors of the environment, as they represent the green environment that is Davao City.  By the end of the show, there was a tightrope act of two men over a cage full of crocodiles. The first man was successful in crossing the rope, the second almost failed, wherein he almost fell to the waters. It was a really terrifying stunt which people from the audience either wished that the man really fell or the whole act was totally unnecessary.  The one-hour show ended with more photo-ops with the animals as well as a tour of the other places of the park. It is well-maintained, but it demands support from the public as well that after the experience, we may have a better appreciation of the animals and nature."
"ztrips11","davao city","April 18, 2011","a real shame for all these unfortunate animals","we visited this park, which is hardly a park, and were saddened by the conditions there. the crocodile pens are practically dry, but for a little filthy disgusting algae crusted water in them...even the breeding tanks look dirty and poorly maintained. the commercials for this place paint an entirely different picture. the rest of the poor birds and other animals are cramped into tiny wire meshed cages that they can barely move in and get tormented by stupid, uneducated visitors. we especially felt sorry for the tigers there, kept in a caged area better suited for a small dog rather than 2 full sized beautiful animals such as these.  this place is small, dirty and overcrowded with little real attention given to the animals there except to make money. if this place were in a first world country it would be shut down by animal rights groups in about 5 minutes. i also find it offensive and discriminatory that foreigeners are charged double to enter cheap circus attractions such as these. i happen to be a foreigner and also a resident of the philippines, so i escape this discrimination, but it's always amazing to witness this ridiculous standard. also something you would never see in a first world country. stay clear of crocodile park...you won't be missing a thing."

Before you arrive in the Crocodile Park you can try the Davao Zorb park which is owned by the same franchise. You can also try a water Zorb (great for little kids!) on a pond they have nearer to the park. Water Zorb is free with Zorb purchase.. There is also a butterfly park in the compound as well, although I have not visited that yet! The crocodile park itself is very cool, it also has birds that can sit on your arm, and other animals like ostrich and civets, to name a few! I loved it.. it was entertaining and well maintained. They also had crocodile shows! They have a small restaurant where I heard you can eat crocodile meat, and I believe they even have some kind of garden with dragon fruit trees, but I did not see it yet because I heard it's new."

When we visited it was a Wednesday and we didn't see anyone past the the main entrance, not even staff so it was like we had the park to ourselves! There are a good variety of animals there and you can get right next to them which is something I've never been able to do. Seriously you could touch the Pythons if you were brave enough (not recommended!) Anyway its not a huge place but good for a hour or so. On certain days they put on a show involving the crocs and other animals which we missed but I hear is very good. Outside the park is the riverside walk where you can get a drink or crocodile steak (if you wish?) and is a nice place to finish the day.   Overall I would say if your in Davao, give this place a visit. Its not going to keep you busy the whole day but is certainly good for a couple of hours. Well done to the staff."

"Wolfchild","","January 15, 2006","It was interesting, a must see:)","This park is a really nice place and I did enjoy my visit to the Crocodile Park near Davao. I have visited it in December 2005 when they have been moving the old park to a new location. Anyway, it was fun to see these big crocodiles from so close distance. I expected the park to be bigger though, they have put some other animals as well there, so it looks like a small zoo. The only thing I didn't like is when I saw some small chicken waiting in the cages of the huge snakes to be eaten by the big reptiles.I would recommend you guys to visit it - it's one of the main attractions in Davao!"
