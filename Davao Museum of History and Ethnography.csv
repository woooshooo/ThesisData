"delight_2016","Davao City, Philippines","March 5, 2018","The information gap","The past event that you have not known about Davao history, will be foretold once you visit the said museum.   Imagine, how the Japanese first settled in Davao city before the WW II, build the city 1st school, hospital, administrative building and other developments that after WWII, they were forcibly returned to Japan leaving behind their fruits of their labor that the Davaoenos would later improved and utilized it for the good of all settlers in Davao even for the future.   Then I was wondering where the known political figure in Danao City, Cebu, PH Duterte's and the Almendras family clan went from Danao City, Cebu on the 60's and 70's .   It was after 40 yrs. after , that I was able to visit the said Museum, I have known their journey to Davao region to became a 2nd Davao city builders for good and just human settlement.   First the Duterte patriarch, the father of our current President of PH, has become the 1st Governor, then a Congressman and a cabinet secretary during late Marcos time.   Then followed by Almendras who was also a great political figure in Danao City , Cebu, PH to became also a governor in Davao when vacated by Pres.Duterte's father when he became a cabinet secretary of the late President Marcos.   The information gap has been filled up when I visited the said museum for the first time alone after leaving Danao city on the late 60's and studying and working until retirement in Iligan City and Lanao del Norte for 40 long yrs.  After all education is a continues process, even retired we can still learn."
"Luke T","Gingoog City, Philippines","May 15, 2017","Interesting visit","I love history and while this museum is very small, it was worth the visit for me. The staff were friendly and helpful. Plus they listened to my questions and had answers to most of them. It would be great if they would expand and get more items and more information to share with the people."
"DonDan16","Hamburg, Germany","January 21, 2017","Nice","A good place about Davao's history. But don't miss the Museo Dabawenyo. This is a different place and often mixed with that. Take your time, read, understand. Davao has a big history and I really think a bright future."
"GreenOnePointFive","Quezon City, Philippines","October 11, 2016","Knowing History is Free","Knowing History is Free. First, to visit the place is Free Admission. You can now learn the history and arts of Davao. Explore the rich culture, biodiversity, tribes and more!"
"arjunsin","New Delhi, India","October 11, 2016","Small and Simple","Its a small and simple museum. I was brought there by the taxicab. But the photo on this page is wrong. The exterior of this museum is different."

"mike k","Dumaguete City, Philippines","June 2, 2016","Good visit","Good choice to a place to visit, however I would have liked to just take my time and look and read everything instead of the guided tour was to short,"
"timballenger","Dumaguete City, Philippines","June 2, 2016","Davao trip","This is the most interesting place we visited in Davao, the Museum is set up really nice and there is a lot of information posted, the tour was too short. If I return I will definitely visit again."
"lookout111","Worthing, United Kingdom","February 10, 2016","fun night out","large pub with dance floor at the back and beer garden in the rear, great for a starter spot for a Friday or Saturday night out, this place is packed but the bar staff could be faster as you can stand for ages at the bar and not get noticed. music is up to date and fun mixed crowed."
"Pasig, Philippines","Pasig, Philippines","February 2, 2016","Another very good museum in the City of Davao","A museum well worth your time to visit if you want to be informed of the history of the Davao Region. Do not mistake this museum for the Museo Dabawenyo which is an entirely different place. The museum is not at the city center, and requires an approximate 30 minutes or more of travel. As part of city life, there is a bit of traffic in going to the place so if you have a limited time for your trip to Davao City, be aware of this factor. There is an entrance fee of 100 pesos as the museum is privately owned. The amount is well worth it, as the museum is in pristine condition, and air-conditioned. The museum showcases the history and culture of the Davao region, and of Islamic and tribal Mindanao. The displays include native cloth and weaving, the clothing of the various ethnic tribes, and the historical artifacts of the region. This museum has numerous excellent displays which will satisfy any history buff visitor."

"Dean M","Mission Viejo, California","January 16, 2015","Small, mildly interesting","It's a small place that's off the main road in a housing development called Insular Village 1. We took a taxi and the staff called a taxi for us when we were done. It's a small two story museum. We initially had a guide but between her English skills and limited information we wound up just walking by ourselves. Does a nice job of outlining the history of Davao City and the surrounding area. Mainly pictures and histograms, not a ton of artifacts to be seen. You can view the entire museum in 90 minutes easy. "

What I noticed, 1: Museum if FREE! 2: They have tour guide for guest 3: It is air conditioned. Talk about using public fund to educate tourist! This is really a good way to get to know about davao."

"christa d","Manila, Philippines","September 22, 2014","Small But Terrible","Small museum located in downtown Davao, near the Catholic Cathedral and the Osmena Park, with many things in it. Cool place. Helpful staff. Very educational. Worth an hour or so if you're within the CM Recto rotunda, before strolling down the park and / or attending service at the nearby church."

"daveblinx","Vienna, Austria","July 27, 2014","Small but beautiful","The small museum of Davao and Mindanaos history is not far away from the really good SM supermarket in Lanang. Combining shopping and culture makes a worthwhile afternoon. Groundfloor you get an overview and with the big mapsite the knowledge where in Mindanoa historic things happened. And history starte earlier than the Spain discovered the island!  First floor you see arts, craft, cloth, music instruments more rhytmic ones and I was allowed to play one to find out the tone changes depending where you touch it. Learned a lot."

"sophiegrayy","Manila, Philippines","May 3, 2013","Diverse Davao","A good way to have a general perspective of Davao.   Davao Museum is a must-see if you wish to learn about the diverse, vibrant cultural influences and ethnic groups in Davao. The museum presents the original settlers of what is now the Province of Davao and Metro Davao - their way of life, homes, tools, fabric, clothing, musical instruments, cultural practices.  Small, tightly-focused collection. Devote no more than 30 minutes to this visit, unless you are in the mood to converse with the staff, who share their insights on Davao's history and origins, and museum trivia - such as: volunteer curators from Alberta, Canada helped in the display design."
"Huminca S","Davao City, Philippines","March 17, 2013","If interested in Davao historie and the people","This is the best place to learn a bit about Phillippines if you visit Davao from an outside country."
"ccduckie","Luzon, Philippines","November 8, 2012","An Educational Trip","If you would want a dose of history about Davao you will definitely appreciate what this museum has to offer. Although small and compact, you would be able to grasp a little bit of a history about Davao (I did not realize that Davao have a lot of Japanese inhabitants doing trade way way way back!). The museum was small as mentioned so we were able to finish it within 2 hours. Recommended for adults and kids alike."
"Clandestinymph","Manila","October 15, 2012","Small and Clean Museum","A small and clean museum that will take u less than an hour to see everything. A good way to spend a morning, jus don't expect too much. Entrance fee is 100 for adults and 20 for children."
"Mercedita M","Jakarta, Indonesia","October 10, 2012","The first place in Davao you should visit before exploring more of the area","I went to Mindanou last August 2012 using AirAsia. Flying from KL to Clark, and from here I continue to Davao. The first time I arrived I was a bit worried because some people said that there is political unrest in Mindanao. In this case the Islamist rebels want to have their own independence. It is said some tourists are kidnapped to highlight their causes. However when I arrived in Davao, Mindanao for the first time, all those fears are gone. Davao and other Mindanao cities are safe to travel. Only in a few area we may need to be careful.  So, to make it short, I went to explore more about Davao which used to be dubbed as Little Tokyo. The best place to dig more information about Davao definetly is the Davao Museum. Free guide is provided which is good. However u cant take pic inside the museum. Well, mabuhay:)"
"Manila","Victoria, Canada","September 17, 2012","Not really a Must-See, but well worth a visit.","It wouldn't be on my top 10 list of things to do in a day, but we really enjoyed this quiet little museum. It had very interesting ethnographic things, including head dresses, photographs, and tribal instruments that looked almost Balinese."
"Chapopos","Manila, Philippines","May 21, 2012","No picture taking","I was so disappointed that they don't allow tourists taking pictures inside the museum. You have no choice but listen to the museum's staff going through some stories about the history of Davao. Expect that the only souvenirs you will get are pictures outside the museum. :("
"raobert","Namur, Belgium","December 30, 2011","Worth a visit","This Museum, although fairly small, is a mine of information regarding history of Mindanao. This info is usually rather difficult to come by. I appreciated also the BW photos from past times showing how the Davao was. There are interesting comments about middle age contacts between Phils and China. Beautiful specimens of Davao clothing are on display, as well as musical instruments"
