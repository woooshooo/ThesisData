"Januspaggers"," ","July 15, 2017","HIGHLIGHT OF SAMAL ISLAND","Love love love the Giant Clam Sanctuary. I've never seen Giant Clams up close so we thought it would be a new adventure. It did not disappoint. We didn't book a tour ahead of time and being low season (right after summer), there weren't a lot of boats that'll bring you across to the floating sanctuary. There was a small boat that offered 1,000, but we had a mini snack with local noodles and the locals said we only had to pay 500. Good thing the boat driver agreed, and we were on our way. The entrance fee was I think 100 pesos and you can rent a snorkel, rash guard and GoPro for a fee. We had all our equipment, but rented out a GoPro. I suggest you bring your own SD card since they don't have one available.   Absolutely had the time of my life. Would definitely go back, plus they gave you an orientation of the cause. So far there are 2,000+ Giant Clams in the sanctuary "

"Jennelyn T","San Jose del Monte, Philippines","February 20, 2017","Amazing!","This is the first time I had the chance to have a close encounter with some of the (soon-to-be) endangered species. Thank you for protecting this sanctuary.They even have a professional diver that accompanies people, and even takes pictures and videos underwater.

"Michael A","Davao City, Philippines","November 9, 2016","Leisure fun","Can be done. However, you should bring your own flippers and diving glasses. Best at new moon or full moon when the low tide is really deep. Otherwise it is rather 3 meters to the animals."

"jblaza","Marikina, Philippines","March 24, 2016","Snorkel alongside giant clams","When we were doing our Samal Island Tour, we made sure to include the Giant Clam Sanctuary in our itinerary. It was well worth the trip.  Prior to the trip, I contacted the Davao del Norte State College about the tour and they were very responsive. They even provided the mobile number of Mr. Xavier Lopez, the head of the Marine Station, for our queries.  From the highway, our habal-habal entered a road and after several minutes of riding, we arrived in Brgy. Adecor. From the Barangay, there is a small wharf where a pump boat can be rented for Php 500, which is paid directly to the boat man; it is good for up to 6 pax and for up to 2 hours. The wharf offers a view of Malipano island and is situated between the Pearl Farm Resort and the Davao del Norte State College Marine Reserve Park where the giant clams are.  (Although the boat man offered to take us around Malipano Island and to the Pearl Farm Resort for an additional Php 500, we opted not to due to time constraints.)  There is a series of huts/rafters built inside the marine reserve park where the boat docks and a short orientation is conducted. The entrance fee is Php 100 per person. It was Ms. Rebecca who gave the orientation and she was happy to answer the questions that we had about the Marine Station and the giant clams. Although snorkels, rash guards, and underwater cameras were available for rent, we brought our own. Drinks (bottled water, soft drinks) are available at the marine station.  After the orientation, we were assigned a guide who would bring us closer to the giant clams. Life vests were provided. We went during low tide and shallower water gave a better view of the clams. We were lucky that we went early and had the entire reserve for ourselves. The guides told us that during peak seasons, they only allow up to 35 pax inside the marine station at a time to prevent untoward incidents from happening (both to the guests and the clams).  Initially, the guide tugged us using a floater. Eventually, we were snorkeling around on our own. Our guide was happy to show us the different species of giant clams in the marine station. Along the sand bar, you can get really close to the giant clams so be careful not to touch/hit them. They cautioned us to not get our appendage inside the clams as it would require killing the clam to open it up if part of the body gets stuck. They added that it has not happened to any guest yet, but we figured that we would rather not be the first. While chatting with the guides, we learned that they were all certified divers and had training for first aid and water rescue.  After returning to the dock, I asked where they kept the young giant clams. Ms. Rebecca said that their office at the wharf served as a nursery, but it is not open to visitors because of biosecurity considerations. She added that the giant clams produced in the marine reserve are given out to the different marine sanctuaries within Samal Island. Nevertheless, we were able to take a peek inside the nursery when we returned to the wharf, albeit from outside the door.  It was great to have a close encounter with these majestic creatures."
"Mariel G","Baliuag, Philippines","March 15, 2016","Almost an hour boat ride was worth it","It is high tide when we arrived in this place. The clams were very big and very great to look at. I really love this place. The guides were all patient enough to help us since we can't step on the clams while we are swimming."
"Leydee D","Samal Island, Philippines","March 3, 2016","Natural and beautiful","Unforgetable experience. I always make sure that my friends and family and guests too would be able to visit this place.. Simply amazing."
"Kates A","Cavite City, Philippines","February 12, 2016","Informative and amazing experience","We paid P1000 for the boat but we were told we can haggle down to just P500. We paid for the snorkeling gears rental, too. They built a wooden house in the middle of the water so they can be close to the sanctuary. Before you get to the water, a staff will discuss few information about the Taclobo and some precautionary instruction. There will be staff assigned per group in approaching the clams, you can either have a life vest, hold a life preserver or just swim.  Its a big farm of giant clams! There are also colorful fishes and starfishes. You can't hold the Taclobo to prevent damaging them and bruising you so be careful. The staff assigned to us is very generous in entertaining us with the history of the Taclobos in Samal Island. Its very informative and we appreciated it. All staff are professional and friendly.  What i love the most is they dont just treat the farm as a money cow for the tourists, they do really care and take care of the giant clams. That is a big plus!"
"Charleen C","Manila, Philippines","February 11, 2016","It's okay","The activity is just okay. Nothing exciting. The only thing unique is that you get to touch a giant clam. The guides and caretakers are very nice and knowledgable."
"Peter19502013","Davao","January 7, 2016","Interesting , beautiful and educational","During a day trip on boat the captain suggested a stop over here. It is really worthwhile to see. The clams and the corals are very beautiful. A good snorkelling stop over including some education about these giant clams. Before entering the water you listen to 5 minutes lecture which makes the whole experience more valuable. This is good for both adults and kids. "
"Grace H","Quezon City, Philippines","January 5, 2016","Amazing experience!","We visited Samal Island last November 2015 and as part of my bucket list, I ""NEED"" to see these giant clams! Going there is quite an adventure specially when you're riding a tricycle. By the way, we rented a trike for  P1,500.00 which includes going to 4 other tourist destinations in the island. As we arrive at Adecor, Samal, you have to rent a boat for P500.00 (1 person to 10 max) which will bring you to the sanctuary. A tour guide will provide you a short introduction on the different kinds of clams you'll see underneath the ocean. There is a fee of P 100.00 (I guess for the maintenance or entrance) and another P 100.00 is you rent a snorkeling gear (which I guess is necessary unless you have your own) The guide/diver will tour you around while holding a floater explaining the kinds of clams underneath you. It was worth it!"
"RickN6900","Los Angeles","December 8, 2015","Nice Snorkeling trip","Spent an afternoon floating lazily along while viewing the giant clams in the bay. There are so many of different colors and sizes. Very nice for those who like to take photographs underwater."
