"Steve J","Norwich, United Kingdom","5 days ago","Worth a look ","We went there on a Sunday we did feel we were the attraction being white tourists but everyone was really friendly Make sure you take your swimwear"
"Karen N"," ","4 weeks ago","Worth the visit","We visited Hagimit Falls as part of our inland tour. The guides are amiable and very helpful. They sure know how to take pictures for your profile picture! The cliff jump to the 13ft deep water is definitely fun and the cave slide is a new experience for me. Kudos to the guides! "
"matei823","General Santos, Philippines","March 8, 2018","Nature! Great side trip","My kids had a blast exploring the many pools. We enjoyed the cool water from the falls. For small kids though, they need to be held and should have flotation devices. The trek upwards after the swimming, not so enjoyable! Overall, a must experience for those who travel to Samal, especially during the rainy months. During the summer the falls have just a little volume."
"Chris P"," ","February 15, 2018","Ok for kids? ","This is a perfect example of how to totally destroy what once was a beautiful place! Garbage everywhere. Fake concrete pools and waterfalls. A huge disappointment!!!"
"RamDurai","Kuala Lumpur","January 24, 2018","Beautiful","We had a great time hiking around taking pictures just wished we swan in the falls.Might be a little hard to find but worth it."
"Peter T"," ","December 21, 2017","Small and safe water fall - a treasure for kids","It is a small waterfall. The lifeguard posted near the fall help new visitors by guiding them and taking them through a cave inside the fall. My son loved the trip and did multiple rounds inside the cave. A small tip made the lifeguard happy. Non slippaey and 5 ft water."
"MrSnatch","Worcester, United Kingdom","December 11, 2017","Nature Tripping","If you want to go nature tripping in Samal and enjoy some cold water, Hagimit is definitely one of those. Just pay 100 pesos for the entrance fee and 5 pesos for the environmental fee. Just a tip, bring food as they dont have food stalls where you can buy food."
"jgayongorsa"," ","November 20, 2017","A breath of fresh air","Having past hagamit falls the other day the wife and i decided to go back there today having checked out a few reviews . It was about 10k from where we are based in lanang. So we fueled up the scooter amd went, it was real easy to find clear signage on main road. Upon arrival we had to pay 5 peso each enviromental, the track down to the falls part concrete part dirt track, plenty of parking and a small store for basic foods amd drinks. Entrance to get us both to the falls was 150 peso there are two parts to this place the free amd the waterfalls source. I must say at this point if you have elderly or disabled in your party its a no as there an incredable amount of very steep steps down to the resort. The park itself has local native people living in and around the area which makes it work well all very friendly. On route you get a glimpse of what you are going to and it was awsome blue looking river very clean i couldnt wait to get down there, its about a 15 minute walk. Finally all you can here is the sound of the fall ! So very relaxing , i just wanted to get changed and jump in, there were some locals already there swimming, again friendly and approachable they said it was deep enough to jump off the rocks so i did!so invigorating clean cold water peacefull and sureen. A great place for pictures and over all well worth a visit, ill be taking the kids there for sure"
"UsapangGala","Pasig, Philippines","October 18, 2017","Swim and Trek","Advisory: 1. I won't advise the place if you have elderly with you. The place requires climbing up and down. 2. Don't set your expectations very high. For me, the place has didn't us a ""wow"" factor but the place is still worth it. The water is not that clear too. 3. If you can't control your kids, don't bring them to this place.   The place is not bad, although I didn't like after your enjoyment on the swimming you may become exhausted when climbing up to the exit.   I hope the place should be maintained otherwise the beauty of the falls will be lost. "
"seedhunter","Hyderabad, India","October 13, 2017","Not so impressive","Although this fall is located in serene ambiance, it is just very ordinary waterfall. But good place for picnic and swimming in cold water. Fee 15 Peso."
"Richee Genesis T"," ","October 10, 2017","Picturesque","P15 entrance fee which is really really worthy. The place is really beautiful. I suggest to go early because at around 10am, people starts to go there and it would be not okay on pictures. Haha. If you're gonna swim, you are required to rent a cottage which ranges from P150-400. Everyone should try the cave hidden at the falls. Quite an experience. "
"Ricky P"," ","October 9, 2017","I wished it was raw","The beauty of nature is not alleviated by any man-made improvements. In my honest and personal opinion, every natural tourist spot should only be reserved by keeping it clean and not modifying it by creating something just for human comfort. This falls should have been a lot more beautiful if it was not turned into a resort type spot. "
"queenmary28","Pagadian City, Philippines","September 13, 2017","Educational Tour","i was so amazed the beauty of Hagimit Falls as my first time to enter Davao. The water is so clear and cold. You can swim how long you want, and you can wear also life jacket for as long as to maintain your safety."
"Aya K"," ","September 10, 2017","Nice, but...","It had rained the night before we went to the falls, so the water was muddy. They only collected half the price because of that, Php50.00 is the regular entrance fee.  We did not stay long as there was nothing much to do with the water looking like that. However if it had not rained, i imagine the place is nice for family getaways or for those who just want to spend some time with nature."
"jonalber2","Singapore, Singapore","September 5, 2017","Like a massage shop you never want to leave","Unfortunately, the rain was pouring when we visited Hagimit Falls on a habal habal. That day, the water looked murky and brown. Our guide said that on a normal sunny day, the water is bluish. Eitherway, already wet and tired, we took the plunge. Once on the rocks, with the water on our backs, my muscles were singing out in praise! This was a great massage to end our day of touring Samal Island. We stayed on the rocks (thank God, we didn't fall asleep) for what felt like hours.   The stairs going down the falls, is very manageable. Not challenging at all. There are also small shops at the water's edge selling snacks."
"Sony A"," ","September 2, 2017","Worth a Try","So this is one of the few trips you can explore in samal island , even though its not really well maintained because of vandalism everywhere, but having said that this place is a worth a try, also its very cheap , from entrance fee to cottages and overnight !"
"Tony_King_Jr","Davao City, Philippines","August 9, 2017","Just don't give up easily","Don't be discourage when going down the stairs. Just be mindful of your safety and belongings. I didn't saw any lifeguard in the area."

"Januspaggers"," ","July 15, 2017","Fuuuuun!! ","As soon as you enter the location, you'll need to trek over a flight of stairs before reaching Hagimit Falls. At first, it's pretty underwhelming since it's just a few levels and not that steep but there's more than meets the eye. There's a staff that is willing to help be your on site photographer (we didn't really sign up for it but it was a great surprise). He's a guide that knows the ins and outs of the falls to give you great insta photos. Apparently, there's a small hidden cave inside the falls and you need an expert to help guide you. There's a sign that says ""No jumping"" but he'll tell you the perfect place to stand and where you should jump to make it safer. All you have to do is to give him a tip.   The benches and huts are charged so we just placed our stuff by the side of the falls. Plenty of other stuff to do but we were already satisfied with the photo ops and the tiny cave. "
"jonsapon121"," ","June 8, 2017","Nice experience ","Fantastic falls. There are some people to help you climb the falls, just tip them. Good service would bring friend next time"
"Jose Victor M"," ","June 1, 2017","Another way of relaxing in Samal","It just takes a short walk and you will arrive at Hagimit falls. We have done a bit of exploring here too and as you go downstream you will see some resorts with rentable huts if you want to have a picnic here. The water is refreshing to swim in so don’t hesitate to take a dip with your companions and enjoy the sound of the falls. It's another way of relaxing in Samal even when you're not in a beach."
"ALventureBlogs","Quezon City, Philippines","May 28, 2017","exciting waterfall","Water is good, cool and clean!!! But man-made structures altered nature. Budget friendly trip. Good for family outing and bonding"
"Roxy604","Vancouver, Canada","April 27, 2017","Nice place to spend the day; popular with locals","It’s quite a ways in (from the highway) to even get to the entrance of where the waterfalls are. The road is very narrow – one lane going both ways; give and take for sure. Small, low-lying cars not a good idea on this path. It’s quite far from the main road, but if you don’t mind the walk (most people do), it should be fine.  It’s probably prettier when it’s brighter out, but when we went there it was a little gloomy so it didn’t look quite as great. It’s a busy place, lots of people having picnics and swimming in the pools by the falls. I believe you can rent little huts and tables for picnic purposes. The main waterfall area is quite busy, but there are other quieter areas around the property, you just have to explore and go against foot traffic.  There isn’t much to see here. So unless you are planning to stay and have a picnic and going swimming, might be best to skip it. It’s just not worth the hassle just for viewing purposes. Also you have to pay a fee to get in."
"niccaalyssa","Manila, Philippines","April 26, 2017","Beautiful View.","This was one of the most beautiful place of Davao that I had visited so far.

"Leiann L"," ","March 2, 2017","Best place to cool down after a tiring day of island hopping","The place is very big and lots of falls to choose from. It can accommodate as much guests as possible. Cottages are spread around. Better to go bere after a very tiring day as the water is very relaxing and fewer people go there around 4pm. The entire falls will be all yours once families and friends go home late afternoon. But not advisable for elders or people with weak knees as there will be a lot of walking on stairs. Ample space for parking."
"Jennelyn T","San Jose del Monte, Philippines","February 20, 2017","Cool waterfalls with a cave inside","The waterfalls were like a therapeutic massage, plus the water is cold, at the side of the falls is a narrow cave (not for the claustrophobic). A very scenic place as well..."
"jan j","makati city","February 14, 2017","Nice place for picnic and little adventure...","Descending down to the falls has been made easy by the cemented stairway. The place is cool and relaxing. Many nice spots for picture taking. It is my first time here to jump off a cliff. And get into a small cave and swim my way out to the open... Worth visiting. There are also huts and grilling place for rent. You just need to bring your own food and buy coconut juice and sticky rice cake from the locals selling along the road to help the locals..."
"Milany A","Davao City, Philippines","February 4, 2017","Coooollllllddddd Water","The place is crowded on weekends but the water remains cold. It was awesome! And very affordable! It is also an adventure going there on a bumy ride or in a heart-wrenching hike. But still, it's a good place and I highlyrecommend it to anyone who would like to relax. It's worth a visit. "
"Victorianlad","Melbourne, Australia","February 3, 2017","Worth a quick visit but not a huge falls","There is a P5 environmental fee charged at the turnoff from the main road with a further P40 payable after a few hundred metres of tricycle travel.  One then walks 300 metres along an at times steep path that has a ramp or steps to reach the falls. Here someone tried but failed to charge me again, perhaps believing I wanted to use a table, although there were only two.  The falls had a good flow but they are only a metre high.  It is worth a visit but do not expect the falls to be anywhere near as good as Tinago Falls outside Iligan City, Mindanao."
"DonDan16","Hamburg, Germany","January 22, 2017","Used to be so nice","The falls are phantastic. Clear cold water. A very beautiful thing.  Not beautiful is the crowds of people making noisy music abd throwing their garbage everywhere, on the ground, in the water, unbelievable. There should be more waste baskets.  Ugly also the tons of concrete and the many buildings there. If you go there on a weekday off season you might have the chance for some silence.

"Wreckxki","Quezon City, Philippines","November 18, 2016","Small Falls","It was easy going to the falls because you need to walk down a flight of stairs, but it was tiring going back to the entrance.   It was a small falls, we went there on a Tuesday but there were quite a number of people. There are tables and cottages available for rent around 150php I think. It would be better to take food/drinks with you because there are not a lot of stores available.   Since there are other falls that are better and nicer in Samal Island. You may skip going to Hagimit especially if you are only on a day tour."

"MediciBoy"," ","October 4, 2016","Beware of this tourist trap","Fees will be asked from you naturally but the moment you step inside that's where the nightmare starts and where the con begins. Sitting on a table next to the falls would cost you somewhere around 150 to 250 pesos and that is depending on who owns the tables.  We didn't spend much time on this horrid place because it was way too crowded. We decided to take the shortcut going back up to where we are parked and to our surprise we were being asked to pay if we would like to use the short cut and the only way we will be allowed to pass there is if we use one of their picnic tables which is far from where the falls are. Unsurprisingly there's a sign on front that says passing through the short cut is free (I assume its the city government who placed it) but the business scam situated right next to the short cut stairs wouldn't allow you unless you pay or you use their tables which is around 150 pesos if I remember correctly. Again, this is a PUBLIC are and this is way too crowded with minimal facilities. So go at your own risk but personally this is rather a waste of time."
"jtwanders","New York","October 3, 2016","Popular Samal Attraction","We visited the falls as part of a day tour.

You can jump on top of the falls (its not that high) but it's not recommended. The water's cold which is very good during summer.   I should highlight though that you can enjoy your stay here without renting any cottages. Our group just saved P300-500 by not renting a cottage because we just placed our items on the ground. Be mindful that locals will come and will charge you of cottage fees just by placing items, or staying for a while, in a cottage."

"Cecilia J","Geneva, Switzerland","May 6, 2016","Cooling waters in the heat","When visitors come over to Davao City and we have time for some pleasant waterfall fun, Hagimit Falls in Samal Island is something we look forward to. We usually go to ""Mahal Resort"", which has a short cut down direct to the falls from its parking area. Though called a ""resort"", it's really just a collection of huts where you can eat and put stuff on, with a collective bathroom and toilet, as well as four airconned bedrooms with their own bathroom, good for overnights or for the day, at reasonable rates. Of course, the main attraction is the series of falls and their basins where people and kids can go swimming or just plain dunking for fun. The water is usually very very fresh, but make sure it has not rained heavily the day before or there may be too much debris being swept away by the flowing waters. There is a little store that sells some drinks and snacks; other than that, you have to bring your own food, cutlery, etc. If you're nice enough, you could request the owner (if she is around) if her staff help could buy roasted chicken in town - of course in addition to the cost of the chicken, you'll have to pay for the transportation and give a tip. In our experience, having been here several times, the falls are always fun; however, it is true as in a previous review that more and more concrete is being built, which is definitely a pity. Also, sometimes the karaoke gets too loud - but then just go into the waters with the gushing flows and you'll hardly hear the horrible noise. Nevertheless, we always leave the place in a fantastic mood."
"Peter19502013","Davao","April 6, 2016","Paradise being destroyed by commercial interests ( concrete walls, fences , wire )","We have visited here many times during the past few years. In most countries a natural pearl like this would be protected from development by law. Not so here unfortunately. One developer has constructed bigger and bigger dams by concrete. This really destroys the feeling of natural beauty. Furthermore this developer seems not friend with the guy( s) next door so they have set up fences and even wire between the falls. A bridge has been closed with gate and padlock. It is really sad to see it going this way. But having said all above, kids seem to enjoy to swim there."

"Mikas101","Singapore","January 5, 2016","Multiple Falls & Multiple Pools","It is a unique place and experience to behold, as one enters the waterfall park. There is a long trek; roughly 500m-1km from the car park to the main swimming areas, but the Government did a great job of cementing steps and there is a ramp which makes it easier. Get ready for some cardio so that your body gets warmed up for the cold plunge in the waterfalls. We took a stroll around the park before going to the main section where everybody was and had a great time enjoying the scenery. The place also has multiple pools for you to swim in and its scattered around so despite there being a lot of people, it does not feel packed. Its unique also that it is in a sense not just one single plunge waterfall but a bunch of them scattered around due to the nature of the river and streaming of the water. And as all Filipino public parks, one can cook or bbq there, but they did a great job in separating it from the main pool areas. There are acceptable changing facilities and toilets there.   Entrance fee:P40 Cottage/Table Rental: P150-P250"
"Ralph S","San Antonio, Texas","December 21, 2015","Wow, what a nice surprise!","The park is about a 10 minute trike ride from the Babak Port which you reach from the SaSa Port in Davao. You can catch the ""banka"" people boats from the Sasa Palenke (market), or the big car ferry from SaSa port. The fare is only 10 piso each way. Once you get to Babak take a trike to the park is about 250 piso (foreigner price ;) . After you enter the park it's about a 5 minute walk down the hill to the falls. The falls will leave you amazed. You can rent a table for 150 piso or a nipa hut for 250 piso. The locals sell beer and soft drinks, no need to bring your own. The toilets are in good shape. You can rent a hut for overnight for 600 or 1000 piso, but no electricity...No swimming after 5pm, so why bother staying there overnight? The walk back up the hill is good exercise...lol The place is crowded on holidays according to the very friendly local workers. We look forward to our next trip back in the new year."

No plan of taking a dip at all because we are heading to the beach. Our short trip to the falls ended up with staying for 3 hours of taking pictures and swimming on its small lagoons. The water was clear and the lagoons have the hues of torquise to blue. Water is cold and very refreshing.  The area is a bit small so I imagine it can get crowded during weekends. I hope the management will limit the number of heads who can visit to maintain its cleanliness and damage to nature will be controlled. Entrance fee is P40.00."

Easily accessible from prime tourist spots via motorcycle.  2. Raw beauty of nature with some modern amenities and electricity but don't expect too much. 3. Cheap entrance fee of Php 40 (less than US$1).  The downside:  1. During my stay, I don't see much uniformed security personnel or life guards roaming around. 2. Rocks could be very, very slippery. If you see it green, test it first for moss that make things a bit dangerous to step on. Be wary of the color of water, the bluer the deeper and the holes could just be right beside you. 3. Needs maintenance."

"Berna T","Las pinas","August 25, 2015","Needs proper maintenance","Going to hagimit falls is an easy 30 to 45mins habal-habal ride from pearl farm. It could be very hot on your way so a sunblock will surely be a lot helpful. I advice that going there you should be in your swim wear because the place doesn't have a decent area for changing. It will be a lot ease that you'll just have to dive in those inviting waters upon arriving. Yes, it could be a hot day going there, but the comfort of diving in the cold hagimit falls could be really refreshing. The waterfalls is clean, maintained and with quite a number of lifeguards you could pay to accomodate overseeing your swimming children if you decide not to swim for a minimum fee. They Also provide rentals for life vests so if you are not a good swimmer you'll feel confident jumping in. I am amazed at how they were able tomaintain the waterfalls area free from vandals but I however feel sad that the area going to the main waterfalls fell short of my expectations. The waterfalls is located about 500m walk down a cemented stairs which in my opinion has ruined the total nature feel for the place. Although, I guess this set up has helped a lot of senior citizens in reaching the place but I'm thinking of using other materials for a stair than having it cemented. It also saddened me that there were vandals in different areas that I almost didn't want to finish the trip. Luckily we finished and it was worth it. My children enjoyed their dip."

Made up of many small falls one after another - cascading down rocks, boulders, and natural terrain along a river - Hagimit is ideal for swimming with its cold, refreshing, and not so deep water. There's lot of fun walking above and hopping between rock formations. Foot bridges are available in some areas. There are cottages and umbrella for guests but no decent food available. Confusing was the rate because except for entrance fee, numerous 'rights' claimants of land along the river bank collect 'fees' each time you hop from one place to another. Better plan your trip; bring anything you need and stay where it is most convenient to you. Unfortunately for us, we never had the chance to swim; the water was highly silted when we went there because of heavy downpour the night before. Take a motorcycle (habal-habal) from the resort (where you stay) anywhere in Samal Island and tell driver to bring you to Hagimit. Make sure to arrange for two-way ride since the place is remote and no regular transport going there. From Davao City - with own vehicle - head southeast on Davao-Bukidnon Road (Pan Philippine Highway) towards De Lara Street then turn left onto Mac Arthur Highway all the way onto Buhangin Underpass then turn right towards Davao-Panabo City Road until you reach the ferry terminal going to Samal Island.

"TangAdrao","Davao City, Philippines","February 21, 2014","Worth Weekend Getaway","HAgimit Falls is located in Penaplata, Samal Island. Like any other local nature attraction, it doesn't have much to offer other than its little falls with its layered natural basins that always make everyone captivated. It is surrounded with dense trees making the experience more like in the middle of a jungle. It's difinitely a one worth destination for family or for anyone searching for a place to be one with nature. One can actually trekk up and find tree house with breathtaking views of the forest. It has some cheap cottages and the entrance fee is just cheap as well.  Bring your own food when planning to spend your lunch or dinner there. The place is quite far from panaplata market so it's more hassle free if you bring food before going there."
"AGV_1419","Mandaluyong, Philippines","January 28, 2014","Waterfalls bringing you closer to nature.","From 40php/person we were given a 50% discount because the river was a lil murky as it rained two nights before.The trail leading down to the waterfalls is about 3-5 minutes walk, so bringing a lot of stuff with you is not really ideal. From the end of the trail you could already see one of the many small waterfalls. There are bamboos and full-grown trees, so you'd feel more closer to nature. :) It separates/split into two as water flows downstream. It's like a ladder of waterfalls of different heights (approx 2 ft to 7 ft) creating natural swimming pools (4ft to 7ft according to the caretaker). There are open cottage and close huts/rooms for rent. If your looking for a side trip or day-tour or picnic venue, I recommend this place. Think twice though if you are planning to bring your young children with you or those who have problems with their knees/knee joints.  *From Davao City ride the City Island Tour Bus going to Samal Island/Kaputian, ask the conductor to drop you off in Penaplata. From Penaplata, ride a habal-habal 20php, one-way, per person."
"Dee G","Davao City, Davao City, Philippines","September 26, 2013","Used to be so Beautiful","We used to go to Hagimit Falls with friends some 9 years ago. It used to be so beautiful. The beauty of the place was not with the falls, but with how secluded it was. There was no entrance fee, no cottages and no stores. The road was not developed too, but again, it was these that made the whole experience fun.  Now, they turned the falls into some sort of resort. Guests have to rent cottages and there's an entrance fee. On weekends, there's a lot of people so expect noise and (maybe) chaos.   If you want to spend the day relaxing, head to a beach instead. I suggest Talicud Island where Leticia by the Sea is. The resort's to die for - excellent for both body and mind.   Here's a helpful article about Talicud Island - http://tropicalvacationspotsblog.com/why-talicud-island-at-davao-city-is-worth-a-trip/"
"My26"," ","September 14, 2013","Blue water","usually the water is not clear if it rained a night before. If you plan to eat your lunch, bring everything from food to plates because they dont have restaurant inside. Many tables, open and close cottages for rent. Water is refreshing, sometimes very cold.  I like the area of Mahal because they make their place like swimming pool type, safe for kids. Ofcourse you still need to watch them very good because sometimes theres a strong current. Also nice concrete pathways (stairs), much easier.  Compared from year 2008 which is natural and not crowded, the place now is full of cottages and entrance fee cost 40/adult, 20/kid.  ATV ride is also available for rent, except when we visit during weekdays."
"Shei928","Manila, Philippines","September 11, 2013","Muddy water..","We were there in the morning but the night before the trip it rained so the water is not clear. Instead of Php 40 they asked for Php 20 because of the color of water. Falls is not that high so don't expect too much. The place is also not convenient to go to especially in habal habal. "
"Dean C","Baguio, Baguio, Philippines","September 10, 2013","Hagimit Falls, Samal Island: Photo Review","It was great visiting Hagimit Falls and Nature Park which was a 10 minute ride after the view point area. Here we had to pay P40/each entrance fee. We felt that everything should be paid in Samal, nothing is free. But since we were already there, we went in and saw the beautiful natural swimming pool created by Hagimit Falls. The water was cold but refreshing. We took a dip and enjoyed the flowing water. Again, we had to pay for cottage fee which is I think was P150 regardless how short our stay was.   More photos and videos of Hagimit Falls are found at : http://watwatworld.com/2013/09/10/discover-island-garden-city-of-samal-a-travel-guide-and-adventure/"
"xChaLeex","Quezon City, Philippines","September 6, 2013","Great but worried about the future of this place","This has been one of the best falls I've ever been. Compared to others, it doesn't have the mother falls of altitude nearby but it has lots of place where you could cool down. The flow of water stretches down to at least 10 pools of water. With cottages all over the place, and ATV adventure for rent, I am a bit worried that this place will lose its beauty in the future if not preserved properly. It is always crowded and therefore nature is abused, I would want this place to be untouched like those of Siquijor and Baler."
"Cqdt"," ","August 9, 2013","Great place for the family","I went to hagimit falls with my family due to curiosity mostly. Entrance fee is relatively cheap and the water was clear and very cold. It's a great place for the family to bond/ talk since there's no loud music or reception. The only thing that bothered me was the maintainance of the toilets and changing rooms. They were horrible. The management should do something about it.  The stairs leading to the falls can be quite challenging to very old people. I'd discourage you to bring them along especially that there are no existing facilities for the less abled.  Overall, I still enjoyed seeing this attraction. It's a nice way to spend an afternoon with the family."
"PDD-101","Davao","July 3, 2013","tut tut what a bad way to treat nature","Took a trip to Hagimit falls and was somewhat dismayed at what I encountered The entrance fee is 20 peso for adults and 20 for kids and then they sting you for another 20 for car parking. As there is no other way to get there apart from your own car (unless you want to hire a local motorcycle taxi) then it is a sting to get a extra charge for parking.  The steps down are steep and the steps have been cut uneven and at different heights and lengths so making the walk more difficult - at the entrance to will start to see the multitude of signs put op to tell you what you can not do  There are no signs to direct you to what you can do or where to go. You end up wondering around the winding badly laid and very very ugly concrete paths that looks like a bunch of kids threw down one sunday afternoon with no planning or supervision.  There is no where to get changed if you want a swim and I saw 2 people having a full wash soap and shampoo in the pools  There is no easy entrance to the water, there was no thought given to how people would get in or out of the pools.  If you stand next to one of the very small and badly constructed open huts for a few second you will feel the air pressure change as people rush to demand 250 peso from you. But look around for help and information and its a ghost town  The ""falls"" them selves are just a few meters high and the pools are full of sharp unseen boulders and stones  As more and more Locals get to travel and see other tourist attractions in other countries they will come back and realise how badly their own natural attraction are being used and abused  A definite thumbs down from me. A drunk blind man could have planned this ""attraction"" better      ."
"MissKellyG","Manila, Philippines","June 15, 2013","Refreshing","For someone who doesn't walk to far places often, I had a harder time climbing down the steps towards the pools of water and back up. But it was worth it when I saw how clean the waters were. It was a refreshing dip."

"6452","Davao City, Philippines","March 28, 2013","Hagimit Falls..hidden no more.","My two elder kids had already visited Hagimit Falls in Samal Island more than 3 years ago, unexploited in the midst of a virgin forest I saw their pictures taken in Hagimit Falls. It was inviting. I wanted to go to Hagimit then but my kids warned me that it is difficult to get there as trail is not yet develop especially for our age. There was no entrance fee then. Until lately I heard that going there is a lot better now as public transportation is already available and concrete stairs are built for easier trail.  Hagimit is in Samal Island, about 2 kilometers from Penaplata Public market. Signage is visible along the national road. P5.00 per person is collected by the local people for environmental fee, My 11 year old daughter is free, but not for the entrance fee which is P40.00 per person. We walked down the cemented stairs for about 15 to 20 minutes to the falls. We had to carry all our stuffs with us, food, bags, water etc. as it would be tiring to get back to the parking area if we left something we need. Hagimit Falls is just a small waterfall that has natural swimming pools. It is hidden by full grown trees and natural vegetation from the hot rays of the sun. I didn’t sun block then. Water is very cold and refreshing. Although Samal Island has a lot of nice and developed beach resorts with white sand and clear and clean waters, Hagimit Falls is a nice destination to visit. It may not be as beautiful and developed but it is still a nice getaway. There is one thing I regret not doing while in Hagimit. I stayed in just one or two waterfalls. I thought that was all. That was disappointing to me because I learned there were still a lot of falls I haven’t seen had I only took time to walk a hundred meters more from the main bathing area. Three of my companions told us they went as far as 150meters more and saw two more wonderful falls. But that was late announcement as we were already on our way back to our van. Maybe for the next visitors, they should try to go a little farther to check. Open cottages are rented for P300.00. Grilling stations and wash areas are available. I don’t like the idea of them charging the public for P5 to P10 comfort room usage. I doubt children would do it somewhere or worst, in the waters just to do away with the fees. I hope this concern would be given attention by the people maintaining the resort."

"Storyseamstress","Philippines","March 11, 2013","Eco-friendly management needed asap","A long trek downhill to these multilevel falls should be worthwhile, but the encroachment of people and their has begun to spoil the natural beauty of the place.

Better management is urgently needed, and the unsightly overnight cottages, unnatural barriers, and other needless concrete structures should be dismantled immediately. "

Some parts are well-maintained while the others are just plain unattractive.  There are some cottages scattered in the area and prices start at ₱50 . Guests at the resort may bring in food and can swim in the area. The time we went there, the water was not clear due to the heavy rains brought by typhoon Sendong.
