"blessie","New Zealand","Reviewed October 15, 2017 ","Peace and Quiet","The place has become even more popular and people come here for Sunday mass. Parking can be a bit difficult because of the number of visitors. The outdoor setting is great for those who just want to listen to the mass and say their prayers in private. A great place to visit for some solitude, peace and quiet."
"Harlem Ray D"," ","Reviewed July 29, 2017 ","Peaceful and Calm","The place is simply reffered to as 'Shrine' by locals like me. The same could even apply to taxi when you intent to visit there. Just say 'Shrine' and more often than not you'll get their.  HOW TO GET THERE! As far as my memory could go back no jeepny route has ever been established there. So if the luxury of time is on your side here is a more adventurous way to go up the Shrine hills.  1. From wherever you are in the city so long as you read the sign board 'Matina' your in lock. Just tell the jeepny conductor or the driver to be dropped by 'kanto Shrine'.  2. Now the fun part. Ride a tricycle up. I tell you its breath taking. Literally. On top of that is the fare of 7pesos only. So tourist please be generous a bit. Its criminally cheap for what the ride up offers. Your prayers start from here.  3. Way of the cross. Ascending up the hill are stations of the cross. A good reason to walk your way up Shrine."
"elviep2014"," ","Reviewed May 28, 2017 ","Very serene place","We were lucky to catch a mass when we arrived around 5 pm. The place have at least 4 altars for worshipping and dropping mass offerings and petitions. You can feel a sense of peace in the area. Close to Jack Ridge so you can go straight to the restaurant after visiting the Shrine. Just make sure that you don't go to the Shrine too late as they might be closed around 6 pm."
