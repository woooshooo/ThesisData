We took a taxi to get to the place which costed around 250 pesos. With the entrance fee of 50 pesos you can get inside the tunnel for 15 mins. with a tour guide. Unfortunately, our tour guide was not informative and accommodating as we expected.We asked her if the statue inside is replica of the Yamashita Treasure and she answered "" of course po! if totoo yan matagal nayang na nakaw.

"SimonDabbs","Melksham, United Kingdom","November 23, 2014","Yes, it's a tunnel, but....","I visited with a friend from UK. A guide walked us through the tunnel which I guess is about 200m in length. It is well lit with a cement floor, and in places you have to duck as the roof is low. But there is precious little to see, and the guide could not tell us a great deal about the history or purpose of the tunnel during WW2. So, rather disappointing. But for 50 Pesos, probably worth calling in if you are passing through on the CP Garcia highway."

Backpackers and tourists who wanted more important attractions to visit may find the place boring, but for a family who needs bonding or a romantic couple who don't have myriad of activities in their itinerary, it is a 'nice to know' place where everyone will enjoy - not the tunnel per se (but) - the amenities offered in this family resort.  Located at Balusong Extension (diversion road going to the airport) Hillcrest Subdivison in Matina District, it is a bit far from the city.

"Davao City, Philippines","Davao City, Philippines","July 25, 2014","Worst front desk staff","The Japanese tunnel is apiece of history. The tunnel was built during one of the world wars by prisoners and served as a base for the Japanese soldiers.  The tunnel is apparently quite long but only a short portion of it is open to the public for safety reasons. The guide was great sharing her knowledge of the site.  Over all the experience was impressive. We decided to stay in the hotel because the staff on duty at the front desk was very helpful. On our last day the staff was just awful. It just goes to show how one bad apple can ruin a good experience. I asked if she could call cebu pacific because I wanted to take durian home with me. She gave me the phone and telephone directory. That did not help me since I was not familiar with the place. I went to the small office at the back thinking they could help me. They promised to call cebu pacific themselves and they would inform me of the results. They called to inform me it was not possible. Guys it can be done. You can take durian with you on the plane if it is placed in a container that is properly sealed. For your information."

The tunnel was made during the world war 2 and used by the Japanese, hence its name. The tour was quite educational but short, around 5-10 minutes. The guide could have spoken more clearly and been much more entertaining--after she cited some facts as we went through the tunnel, we had to prompt her with questions to learn more. Towards the end, her mind had wandered because when my friend asked her a question she made that sound you make when you're not really listening anymore. If you have been to other historical tunnels like the Vietnam and South Korea, you might be left wanting for more. If you haven't been to one, it's still worth a visit. If you're pressed for time or not really into historical places, I would recommend visiting the other tourist spots instead."

It was built during the Japanese invasion of the Philippines. Accordingly, Japanese loots gold bar was hidden here. Some swallow and their nests can be seen upclose."
"iamatopmodel","Davao City, Philippines","August 6, 2013","Not the regular kind of tour","It really helps to train their tour guides well in explaining the history of the tunnel. I thought our guide was well informed and friendly. I just wish that what theyre sharing with us are all facts (we have no way of proving otherwise)."
"igga200"," ","August 3, 2013","piece of history","i have learned not to expect much when visiting tourist spots in the philippines since mostly they are false advertising. however, i actually like visiting the tunnels because it was an educational visit. the tour guide was really pleasant & patient with us & we learned a lot about davao from her."
"Dibyne","Davao City, Philippines","July 30, 2013","literally, Tunnel!!!","Here, its a different kind of adventure.. hiking through their tunnel.. but expect the food to be very basic, though lately, there are renovation and improvement of the place.   To make the trip more interesting, make it part of your itinerary to visit also crocodile park.."
"maincampus","Cotabato City, Philippines","May 8, 2013","wonderful memories","we had three birthday celebrations at Japanese Tunnel, and i would say it was an exhilarating experience. The location is ideal, and the amenities like the use of the pool made the parties more fun. The place is ideal for selected visitors, and so exclusive events are welcome in this resort.Although it is not as big as the other resorts, it has its own attraction too, like the tunnel,Food is good, and the staff is always ready to serve.During free time, this place is perfect for the kids.. and adults for dining. My grandchildren enjoy the clean and exciting design of the swimming pool, and so they always invite me to visit the place all over again. Parking is not a problem, now that it has extended its parking space. I would want to be back to this place, be cause it makes me recall the blissful experience of our family gatherings."
"Cotabato City, Philippines","Cotabato City, Philippines","May 4, 2013","A family celebration","We only saw the tunnel briefly and there was nothing more to see since the tunnel is short, but it served its purpose. Why? Because it is considered a landmark, one of the remaining souvenirs of past Japanese invasion. The saving grace is the swimming pool, found just nearby, good for kids and adults alike. The kids enjoyed swimming in the long pool, with the recently added features found at the end. You can order food and eat there while watching everybody. The food is just right, and the service is superb. And if you don't have your own ride, it is easy to hail a taxi or you can request the staff to call a taxi for you. Or if you intend to stay overnight, they have good hotel rooms you can choose. We've been here many times already and still wanting for more!"

"RogerbDavaoCity","Davao City","June 8, 2012","THE JAPANESE TUNNEL RESORT, HOTEL, RESTAURANT - Good food and a trip back to Davao City's recent past","BY ROGER M. BALANZA durianburgdavao mindanao newsblog http://durianpost.wordpress.com  There is a place in Davao City where you can both have a taste of the best food the premier city of Mindanao can offer---and a chance to make a trip back to Davao City's recent past. D’Japanese Tunnel Family Resort and Restaurant, snugly nestled on a slope in Balusong along the Carlos P. Garcia Highway (South Diversion Road) is both a landmark destination for tourists for its historical value and good food. A main attraction is the 300-meter Japanese Tunnel, constructed in 1942, a reminder of the Japanese Occupation during World War II. A guided walk through the deep tunnel is an eerie experience, given stories about the brutality of the war that did not spare the Dabawenyos. The tunnel, built on forced labor by the locals, served as cover and storage for armaments and soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army. The visitor/tourist is greeted by life-size replicas of Japanese soldiers at the entrance to the tunnel. Inside there are various weaponry (vintage machine guns, ammos, guns explosives); tables and chairs in what looks like the office or command center of the Japanese soldiers. There is a chapel with a replica of a huge Golden Buddha, Japanese bank notes and holding cells apparently for captured American and Filipino soldiers. You get the rare experience for only P50 entrance fee.  The Japanese Tunnel has a 3-storey hotel, a swimming pool and the restaurant now also making waves for good food (Chinese, Filipino and Western cuisine and, of course, Japanese!) and becoming as famous as the tunnel.  Buttered, Chicken, Mixed Seafood Vegetables, Sinuglaw, Sweet and Sour Lapu2x, Sinigang na Hipon MADAYAW DABAW!!!"
"LolaGo1","Washington DC, District of Columbia","May 28, 2012","TUNNEL VISION OR NOT?","My tour package included 4 sites of Davao City - the Japanese Tunnel is one of these sites. As mentioned in several reviews, the tunnel is very short with only a handful of displays From my tour guide, I learned that the tunnel was discovered during the construction of the highway facing the tunnel.   What impressed me most are the stalactites and stalagmites on the walls of the tunnel. I only noticed them when my tour guide brought them to my attention  For those interested in tunnels used during the World War II, I suggest that a visit to the Malinta Tunnel located in the Corregidor Island be made."

"Macben_1969","San Fernando La Union, Philippines","April 25, 2012","Quite eerie but nice experience","We went here on our way to the Phil eagle center. The place looks eerie and dark esp since we were the only visitors at that time although there are installed lights inside. While inside the cave you can hear some buzzing/rumbling that reverberates inside the tunnel coming prob coming fr vehicles outside which adds to the eerie feel. The guide showed/told us the interesting sites/stories behind the Golden buddha replica inside and the lifesize japanese army figures inside. There is an entrance fee for a guided tour of this 300m tunnel. A very informative experience you should not miss when visiting Davao. And since this is a resort, you can check also check in their hotel which is perched on top on the hill where the tunnel is. They have a nice pool. Food at the resto isn't so good though."
"joeydvm","Ha'il, Ha'il, Saudi Arabia","April 20, 2012","tunnel experience","the tunnel views are somehow spooky but its okay. They do a hotel within the property but be prepared to have a long stride up to your rooms. They have a pool also if you to splurge to some swimming fancy, right beside their resto..."
"imojen","Manila, Philippines","March 23, 2012","don't expect much","the tunnel is very short with only 2-3 exhibit spaces. no one can give you a tour and the japanese restaurant does not serve any japanese food. but definitely a nice stopover when you are on the road."
"Mark E","Makati City","March 20, 2012","Brings you Back in Time","It simply brings you back in time. The tourist guide was knowledgeable. She answers all our questions regarding the tunnel. It's nice to know that this place has been preserved. We were told that it was discovered at the time the national highway is in construction. Also, it is a longer tunnel but it was cut to just cater to tourists.  Make sure you wear shoes or sandals that you're ready to have wet. The tunnel has a dry to wet flooring and is muddy at some points. Also, make sure that you're ready to dock a bit as some ceilings are low even for an average person."

At the time we visited, the tunnel was cut short by a gate. They were renovating the other part of the tunnel then, probably placing more Japanese soldier replicas. Stalactites are starting to form inside the tunnel."

"codad1946","Davao City, Philippines","June 5, 2011","Should be upgraded","I was looking forward to visiting this place because I live in Davao but had never been. It was good, but I was disappointed that they had not made more of it - probably a funding problem or lack of will, who knows. I thought there would be a museum attached to it, but apparently everything had been removed to a downtown museum, so that was a disappointment too, though to store the stuff at this site would probably have been expensive to do regarding air con, security etc. I think they should open more of the tunnel, even though it is a home for pythons apparently(!) as it goes some 30k according to the guide I seem to remember. They should map it out and give out a guide book or sheet to show where it goes/went and what is at the other end and why. Come on guys, do more with it like this and tracing Japanese and Filipino survivors if there were any etc etc."

"Sui_Lai","Davao City, Philippines","March 28, 2011","Perfect beauty","Even if I was a local native here in Davao, it was my first time to visit Japanese Tunnel. I fell in love immediately with the place because of its perfect beauty. I was searching for a reception of our wedding when I remembered Japanese Tunnel and it so happened that it's nearer than having it at downtown areas. The name itself captured my eyes because the theme of our wedding was sakura (means cherry blossom. Cherry blossoms is prominent in Japan). Because I personally attended all our wedding details - from invitations, giveaways and cake - they were all cherry blossom inspired. Anyway, we took their wedding package which wasnot so expensive. The package includes food for 100pax, overnight stay and free pool passes. The rooms that we had stayed was nice with the view of their pool below. The food was great and their staff were accommodating and friendly. It was memorable and wonderful experience for me."
"thedude_888","Budd Lake, New Jersey","March 14, 2011","Worth going to","This is living history. You actually get to go into the tunnel and walk around to see how the soldiers lived etc. There are very few WWII places that you can actually walk into and see for yourself. Davao is off the beaten path; if this were in Manila, everybody would of heard of it. If you are in Davao, this is a must see for history buffs. Plus, like a previous review stated, a nice break from the heat. It's at least 20 degrees cooler in there."
"ccduckie","Victoria, Canada","December 8, 2010","Pretty Cool!","I liked this attraction for a couple of reasons -  First of all, yes it is a bit kitschy... there are statues of Japanese soldiers, a 'wishing well,' even a Buddha! I really had fun exploring the tunnel. I hate the heat, and it was such a nice cool place to be on a sunny day. The tour guide was a bit overly friendly, and tried to up sell us on a meal at the restaurant or a stay at the pool, but I didn't mind. If I had known there was a pool, I would have planned to stay the day there! They also have hotel rooms available, and it seemed like a nice option to stay for a night. If I had visitors in Davao I would definitely take them here for a day or a half-day."
"USA","USA","July 23, 2008","Japanese Tunnel worth a LOOK","The tour was short and the guide did not have alot of information. We would stop at one wing of the tunnel and he would say this is where the command center was, this is where they kept supplies. not much information.  The tour cost me 50 pesos per adult, the family that took me said that they seen that I was an American so charged me more. At any rate it was worth $1.25 US just to look it over. The hotel looked very nice and had a nice pool and landscape with flowers. I would have stayed there over night but had alread booked another place."
