"Maricar F"," ","September 5, 2017","Value for money","Been here 3 times already. The water is clean only in the morning especially if high tide. Best to do is to plan your trip by googling the tides chart so you'll know if when will be high tide in Kaputian. The beach becomes dirty...More"
"Tom G"," ","June 28, 2017","Great beach day out","This beach is a beautiful tropical paradise, the water is pleasant and the beach is not crowded at all. Great for having lechon and a feast.

"DonDan16","Hamburg, Germany","January 22, 2017","Beautiful beach","Try to go there on a weekday off season. Then you have the best chance not having to watch people t growing their garbage and making noise. In any case you should wear bathing shoes."
"IceQueen2013","San Francisco, California","January 15, 2017","Kaputian Beach Park","Beach was okay, but there's a deep drop from the beach line so be sure to watch your children when swimming, they might wade too far into the drop and drown easily.

"macasaetchris","Makati, Philippines","December 14, 2016","Your average white sand beach","Entrance fee: 10 pesos per head Good:  1. Water - Clear  2. A place where you can celebrate with friends and family 3. Local stores are available just outside the beach area 4. White sand  Bad: 1. Can get crowded and loud during weekends (People singing videoke, drinking and playing games) Not a great place if you want some quite time  2. There are some bottles lying around the beach area and also in some parts of the swimming area.  3. Lots of sea urchins (wear aqua shoes!)  I wish their LGU help clean and maintain this place. "
"77Raine27","Cavite Province, Philippines","September 8, 2016","Nice Beach","Went there to see the white beach. Compared to the beaches in Panglao and Bantayan, these 2 are well-maintained. Needs cleaning on the shoreline. Did not dare to swim."
"musickaren","Mandaluyong, Philippines","August 25, 2016","great beach.","can be seen from isla reta beach. white sand and calm waters and long shoreline. there's no boat though from isla reta to kaputian beach(or maybe you have to rent a whole boat) affordable entrance fees."
"Munky08","Pasig, Philippines","June 1, 2016","Nice sand but too crowded","The sand is indeed nice but since this beach is open to the public, it gets a bit crowded during summer."
"Angela M","Pasig, Philippines","February 12, 2016","Well maintained","Clean. well-maintained. Cheap entrance fee. Very nice shore line. Its fine, powdery sand really represents its name ""Kaputian"" which means ""whiteness"" or ""white""."
"Alex39662","Davao City, Philippines","February 4, 2016","Beach better have my money.","The Kaputian shoreline has a great view of nature with white sand beaches and is home for several marine creatures such as the dugong (sea cow). This beach better have my money. The fine white sand beach will surely make you stay longer (or live there forever). Its a place you must not (ever) miss."
"Kates A","Cavite City, Philippines","February 1, 2016","Will come back","During low tide, it reveals a good stretch of powdery sand. I like it here. It can be dirty though after a storm."
