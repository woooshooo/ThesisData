"efrenr916","Taguig City, Philippines","February 27, 2018","The best place for chilling in Davao","The place offers a wide variety of restaurants, bars, and night spots. The most popular is ""Kanto"" with a live band performance. Bands are rated and allows jamming and dancing. Wide variety of delicious pica picas and beers from all over. Smoking area at the parking area."

"Valdis A","Kremenchuk, Ukraine","January 4, 2018","Live band show!","Coming here to the central big stage hall for live band performances on weekend. Great bands, great sound, great ambiance.  Lots of small bars/restaurants around with own designs and entertainment. bucket of beer is only P250 Always crowded.  You definitely will find something special up to your taste. If you using a taxi - better give small bills like P20 to the parking boys to get you a cab fast. Otherwise you will wait long especially on weekends."
"lionlamica","Florida","November 9, 2017","Alot of food choices","Went to check out BLUGRE durian coffee and Aling Fopings halo halo. Well me and my daughter got the durian coffee and it was not that good to us, I like durian but not in coffee. The staff were nice and the place had great ac and was very clean. I would go back but next time I would get something else. The halo halo at aling fopings was just ok and you have to pick your toppings just make sure you get them we did not get all of ours. Would I go back may be but not for the halo halo."

The reason I called it ""haven gig"" is because we come to this place in Davao City, Philippines as often as we could just to hang out.......So many restaurants to choose from....BUT a must try ""halo-halo"" from Aling Foping is to die for (not literally)........adults, kids, senior citizens...all these people are welcome❤️"

It's in front of Ateneo High School and is just walking distance from NCCC Mall. The place houses various restaurants and coffee shops and even offers some night life until midnight (since there's curfew in Davao). I recommend Taste of Home and Aloha Bar for dinner, and BluGre Coffee for the best Durian Coffee you can ever taste. :) "

"Cookie O","Davao City, Philippines","December 30, 2014","Weekend hangout","Matina Town Square aka MTS, is a laid back place with a bunch of BBQ stalls around an open stage area where you can relax and listen to live music with a beer in one hand an a BBQ in the other. The crowd is mostly composed of teenagers and young adults who just want to bask in the open air and eat decently priced food while listening to live music. Besides the BBQ stalls, there are nearby fastfood joints like Jollibee and McDonald's. There are also some decent cafes, sweetshops, restaurants, arts and crafts stores, and travel shops around. On particular days they have mini bazaars where you can find bargain items and clothing.  The venue itself is well maintained. The toilets are properly working, the doors and roads are clean and functional. Security is also decent.  Try this place out during the weekend for more interesting sights or weekdays for a more relaxed vibe."

A lot of locals hang out here especially at night where it can be packed and parking will be hard to find. If going by taxi, no problem. The halo-halo place is popular and you choose what toppings you want on your halo-halo. It is yummy but it seems you pay more for what you get. Still worth to try. There is also an area that usually holds zumba classes which adds to the lively atmosphere. You can also find tour offices, salons and spas on the second floor. Overall an okay place where we go for an errand or particular food. Tourists may find nothing to really do here unless they want to just sit and hang out."

"Muntinlupa, Philippines","Muntinlupa, Philippines","August 20, 2014","The GIMIK place","I like Matina Town Square, known to locals merely as ""MTS"" because it shows the soul of Davao. It is a complex of bars and restaurants, one of which has a live bands. Beer and Fingerfood ""Pulutan"" are the standard fare in this busy, fun place. This is also the place where smokers are assigned a smoking area, far away from the generally non-smoking Davawenos. "

"Lei P","Taguig City, Philippines","July 22, 2012","2AM Curfew - Not For Party Animals","We went here at around 11PM to relax after our strenuous itinerary. I just want to drink a couple of beers and eat some local food. There's a live band playing. It's ambiance is similar to Central of Manila. After we ate our dinner at around 15 past midnight, we ordered 2 buckets of beers. At 1AM, the band stopped playing and some restos closing. At 1:45AM, you can only imagine how my friends reacted when they started to turn off all the lamp posts. I'm indifferent but my friends were so pissed off. The following day, we decided to hit the place at around 7PM. By the way, they only have one smoking area so be prepared for a little inconvenience. "

"maia_cyllene","Cebu City, Philippines","May 24, 2012","NIGHT OUT!","I always hang out in MTS. Barbeque Boss serves cheap but delicious barbeque. Beers are served ice-cold always.  Whistletop is also nice. Although service crew is a little slow at times.  Bazaars are seen on Fridays. Pre-loved stuff and other products.  A good place to chill with friends!"
"inabear","Laguna Province, Philippines","May 11, 2012","Nice hang out","As a tourist destination, it's not much. Just a playground for the kids (although mine really loved it), a few shops and several restaurants. However, as a place to hang out, eat bbq, have a couple of beers and watch some local bands, it is ideal. I think MTS is better appreciated if you are a local, or if you've been to Davao many times and just want to hang out someplace to unwind. Or, if there is a special event like during Kadayawan."
