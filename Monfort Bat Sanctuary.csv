"Peter T"," ","February 15, 2018","Well worth the trip! ","We found the bat cave fascinating! After seeing this on National Geographic we had to visit this place! The bats start leaving the Cave around 6 pm. If you’re here in the daytime can still see the bats from four or five different openings. Would recommend bringing mosquito repellent as there was lots of mosquitoes due to the recent rains. "
"jgayongorsa"," ","December 11, 2017","Worth your 100 pesos","Still a Guiness Title holder, the bat cave would offer you sightings of the 5 open caves that holds thousands of bats for 100 pesos. Although you wont be able to go inside the cave, you wont even dare going near the cave because of the stinky smell of their poop.   The Tour guide is very nice too. "
"beaverrogers","Ayer, Massachusetts","October 28, 2017","needs more development","Upon hearing the phrase “bat cave”, i really thought that we could enter and explore the cave. these are just 5 open underground caves wherein you could take a picture only from the outside. you will need a long range camera to take a good shot of the fruit bats. they have a nice and welcoming tour guide. suggest they would develop the bamboo fences around the caves and fix and clean their comfort rooms.

"pastelprism","Manila, Philippines","October 17, 2017","Better to come here at dusk","So our first stop in Samal Island was here at Monfort Bat Sanctuary, upon entering the premises you will meet a staff who collects the environmental fee on the area.  By the way, we went there via a habal-habal (local term for the motorcycle used as public transport)  You will pay P100 and after that the guide will introduce the place like, how was the place was discovered, why was it called Monfort bat cave and also a brief introduction about the facts regarding the main attraction--bats.   What to expect?  Other than the bats, also found in the cave were bayawak (monitor lizard) and yup... snakes. Consider yourself lucky if you see a bayawak inside the cave since it is rare that it goes near the opening of the sinkholes.  You will see first the opening of the cave, then just a few climbs you will see the 4 sinkholes which will give you a bigger peek on what the cave looks like inside and how big is their colony.  Best time to see the place? According to the guide, normally tourists would like to see the (I forgot the exact term) coming out of the bats and their formation. And this only takes place at.. just as i have mentioned... dusk (around 5-6 PM)  Important to note also from the tour is their ecological importance and their relation to Durian."
"seedhunter","Hyderabad, India","October 15, 2017","Nice to Know More About Bats","It's our first time to see so many fruit bats up close and knowing about the different rooms they occupy (based on life cycle). The guide is nice, knowledgable and knows how to inject humor so you won't get bored. The trip was short and sweet, 30 mins is enough. Please note that the place has a certain stench that might not be appreciated by some so better bring a towel or something to cover your nose while going around. Make sure to include this place in your itinerary."

"Januspaggers"," ","July 15, 2017","Informative, interesting ","I suggest you waiting for a guide (opens at 8am) so you'll get more substantial information. We've been to a lot of caves in the Philippines but nothing quite like this. Even though you can't enter the caves, it's pretty interesting. There's a lot of info around the area and they've preserved the site really well. It isn't a must-see place if you don't have a lot of time, but if you're in Samal for more than half a day, then it's a good stop. "
"Jose Victor M"," ","June 1, 2017","Quick informative side trip","I put this into our itinerary since I don't know much about bats and to be honest I thought I can see and touch a bat up close like the one I experienced in Boracay . Contrary to my expectation we did not see one up close yet we saw a their habitat at a distance and had a guided tour around the cave premises. We also gained information about these creatures and the dedicated stewardship that the owner shows.   It can be a quick side trip for those who want a break from the sea and beaches of Samal."
"Grace B","Davao","May 22, 2017","Informative visit ","My family had a chance to visit the Monfort Bat Sanctuary as one of the highlights of our inland tour in Samal.   The Monfort Bat Sanctuary is one of the tourist attraction in Samal because it is the home of Geoffrey Rousette fruit bats. There are millions of these bats in one cave with several openings.   We learned that it is the largest single colony of this kind of bats , which earned the place their Guinness World Record. Our guide informed us that these bats can reach as far as Bukidnon just to look for food at night but all of them always come back to this sanctuary in the morning. These bats eat the flowers of durian and other fruits and nectar. These bats are also the prey of crows and snakes. Dead bats are also eaten by the rats.   The cave has several openings, the tour guide showed to us the big opening where mating usually happens and where they train their young. In another opening, we found mostly males while in another opening , the aged ( senior citizen , they said) are found.   The entrance fee to this sanctuary is P 100.00 and you pay P 5.00 for environmental fee.   Upon entering the place you can already hear the sound of the bats and smell their pungent odor. Visitors can wear masks upon entering the place.   This place is worth a visit if you are in Samal Island. "

Each sink hole is for a specific age group of bats and purpose... Mating Bat for mature bats which intends to mate or make new baby bats.

For 2 hours one can visit the Monfort Bat Sanctuary at up North and some enough time to Hagimit Falls for 300 Pesos per head.  Driver is provided negotiating through rough up and down terrain, passing through town and up to the mountains. From Pearl Farm is about 50 minutes. (If I drove that bike perhaps I would have run it in lesser time. it seems that they run is at a pace for some reason)  Now The BAT Cave The Bat Caves are divided to 4 chambers group into several social divisions 1. Lovers Chamber This is where the mating happens. The male ones have swollen penises and copulating with the females in what it seemed a Dracula's embrace. Other males are flying around showing off their skills to attract females.  2. Training Chamber This is where the young ones are grouped. You will notice that most bats are small sizes and it seemed they are taught by a few bigger ones how to glide/fly.  3. Old Age chamber.  This chamber holds the quiet ones, Very little movement and flying around.  4. Exit chamber This is the far end of the cave for entrance and exit.  During dusk, a nice display choreographed flight are displayed by the bats.   No food sold here. Bring water and umbrella. A 50 minute ride can burn you in the sun so protect yourself.   A must attraction when you visit Samal Island. A few bat caves are in Palawan and other mountainous regions but nothing close to this. 2.5 Million bats and counting. They fly to Davao peninsula to the mountains feeding on fruits and insects during the night. They comeback the almost the dawn of the next day. A spectacular sight."

The sounds they make and their unique walking movement are interesting enough in themselves.   The helpful guide told us that bats segregate their society into different groups. There is a mixed group, a maternity group (yes, really), a teenager group and an adult male group. They all behave differently. Beware - the adult male group stinks!  This is all in a pleasant location with good views. Do take water though, as there isn't an aircon room in sight. Well worth a trip."

It's truly breathtaking.  Just like you I do not like going into bat caves, first of all it's dark, you can hardly see anything, it smells awfully awful and it can be scary. But this bat sanctuary is nothing like it. You do not have to brave a hole full of bats just to witness them up close, they are kept in large and deep sink holes where you can appreciate them while you're out in the open. You can still smell them yes, but you can always cover your nose and step away if you cannot take it anymore. There was a nice girl tour guide who showed us the sink holes, and patiently explained the details.  Monfort Sanctuary also holds night tours when bats go out of their caves to eat fruits. Advance booking is required to join this tour. And according to the tour guide, the night tour guests are required to bring and use umbrellas because bats might poop on them.  Entrance fee: Php 100 per head"

As for our visit, we did not gave our tour guide tip because we thought entrance was too much. "

"Veloce298","Manila, Philippines","September 22, 2014","Guinness-Breaking Bats","The bats that inhabit the caves in Monfort Conservation Park was said to have numbered to millions breaking the Guinness World Records. The bat sanctuary is a privately-owned property with natural caves conducive for survival and shelter of bats. Here they formed colonies of more than million individuals There are openings on top of the caves where visitors can watch how the bats are doing down under.  Bats are nocturnal mammals capable of sustained flight, so that they sleep during day time and go out as hordes during night time in search of food. While about 70% of bats consume insects for survival, bats here were said to be fruit-eating bats going as far as the mainland of Mindanao before returning back to Monfort at dawn. Boring as it may seem, you can see those bats hanging upside down - one on top of another - making a thick wall of bats that darken the cave at day time. It was said that the best time to watch them is during early evening when bats start to move inside the cave and out to fly. While day tour at Monfort ends at 5 PM, interested guests may make arrangement with Monfort staff for a nigh visit."
"igmegalingan","Makati, Philippines","September 21, 2014","Definitely go in the evening to see the bats flying","We got there at 4.30 which was good as we saw the caves in the light then stayed until it got dark at 6pm.  Once it gets dark the bats take off swirling around in a mass throng of movement and noise. The set up at the sanctuary is good with the cave entry holes fenced off and secured and they gave us torches to see into the cave as well as help our footing.   We got the timing correct but if you are planning to be there late then call or SMS otherwise they close up at 5pm and go home. The daytime charge of php 100 goes up to php 200 for the night visit, but we thought it was well worth it.   Guides, anna and Jodie, were friendly and enthusiastic and definitely wanted to show us the centre.  All I all a good place to visit"

You will need proper tools to see what those bats really look like and be able to take some worthwhile pictures of them home.  For safety reason tourists can only look around the various openings around the cave and at the safety of daylight. The bats numbering in the millions according to estimates can easily overwhelm you should they wish it. The guide said there are night tours too. I wonder how that goes.  But without said tools seeing all those bats together is still quite something. Just open your nose."

It was a good finale for the tour. The place was called Monfort Bat Sanctuary and it was listed in the Guinness world records as the largest colony of Geoffroys Roussette Fruit bats estimated at around 2,500,000,00 with two albino bats. Again we had to pay P100/head entrance fee but to me it was worth it.  The bat sanctuary is home to the largest colony of fruit eating bats in the country. Going near the caves was already a challenge because of the strong smell of bat poop. There were five caves in that area and we enjoyed watching the bats fly and interact with each other. They looked like small rats with sharp teeth and wings. For more photos and videos of the MOnfort Bat Cave, Please visit: http://watwatworld.com/2013/09/10/discover-island-garden-city-of-samal-a-travel-guide-and-adventure/"

Bring a camera that can capture motion well and you might just photograph a bat in flight. Their cries, like shrill birdcalls, are otherworldy when standing mere meters away from them.

"Pierre C","Cebu City, Philippines","April 26, 2012","If you never saw one","I thought initially that we would go inside a cave but you are simply looking at the cave from few holes spread on top of an hill. Impressive though. Think about it. How have Guiness done to calculate that there was 1,800,000 bats into it in 2006 and more than 2,500,000 now? The local guides will take the time to answer all your questions and between others, to describe how bats are responsible of the huge number of duryan trees in the Davao area. I have been told that the best time to go there is at sunset when the bats are leaving to feed themselves. We have been there in the afternoon and if it is fun to see the bat walls, it is not dynamic a lot. There is a fee to visit the site but they found a way to add an entering fee when there is nothing else to do than to look at the bat cave. Can they not combine their fees on a single ticket?"

The bats all live in a single cave – guests aren’t allowed to enter.but they can peer over bamboo railings into any of five openings where the seething masses of sleeping fruit bats can be seen coating the cave walls.  At first I ddnt know that the biggest colony spices can be found here in Philippines thou I’m a Pilipina and I just known it recently (as I don’t go out often cuz of my nature) But I don’t want to miss my chance to see them ..soo when my Bf asked me for some tourist spot I recommend him this Bat Sanctuary. (I mean why not dba?)  But when we got there (that’s was 4-5 months ago I guess?) I was amazed! They’re really to many. (I mean WOW).it confuse me..”how did those resident scientist notice or know their counts?  Well anyway I did asked them..and our tour guide said that they have this machine that help them to counts all of em ;)  Some of this Bats are pregnant So... if before they are 1.8M then expect it now to be more than that as female bats were almost continuously pregnant.  And if you notice on the pics Its really kinda Dark inside  I also found out that Male Bat's ""pee"" is more stinky than female Bat..

From Davao, you can go to Island Garden of Samal by riding on a barge (sasa wharf) around p10-15. When you're in Samal, there are motor bikes willing to drive you to the Monfort bat caves probably for p20-50? per person. You can also rent out a whole jeepney but that will cost you extra.  The best time to go here is during sunset when all the bats fly out of the cave. I have to warn you--- the bats are noisy and the smell is nasty (sweet smelling urine???) but it's all part of the experience, if you ask me. The cave isn't cove-like. It's more like an underground cave. You'll know what I mean when you visit.   My cousins and I went there around 6pm. It was dark already. The entrance fee costs extra for night viewing but it was worth it. The bat population was so thick, the walls of the caves were packed with bats. There were also plenty of bats going out of the cave.  The same cave was features in the Local TV channel (ABSCBN's kuya kim show) and is recognized all over the world.   If you go here with your own car or if you're the adventurous sort, do stop by their falls. I forgot the name. You can probably ask the locals about it. The falls have several pool pockets that have crystal clear waters. Entrance fee is probably around p20? It's 15-30 minutes from the bat cave. I'm not really sure, it's been a while. Don't hesitate to ask for directions. The locals are really friendly and helpful. :)  happy trip!"
