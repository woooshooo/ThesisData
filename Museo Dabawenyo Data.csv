"small-skiing-mole ","South East England","3 weeks ago","MUST SEE! Learn about Davao's history & its indigenous people. Incredible staff","Really enjoyed visit to this small museum established by Pres. Duterte's mother who wanted to inform and educate people about the 11 indigenous tribes in Davao City. This is only the start of the musuem, it continues with the history of the area, Spanish, Japanese and American influences and the establishment of the city. The displays and information are good and there are some interesting exhibits, but, to get the most out of your visit, talk to the staff who are knowledgeable and helpful. Currently there's an exhibition by a local painter on the top floor, which is also a must see as her work is superb!"

"Monica P ","Dubai, United Arab Emirates","May 27, 2017","I love the fact that it offers a free guided tour","It's a small cozy museum and may not be advisable if you are not accustomed to big traveling groups as the guided tour can be too fast / wordy. 50% of the info are about the ruling political family.

"travelbug47london ","Quezon City, Philippines","May 10, 2017","A modest attempt to explain the history of Davao","The free entrance comes at the price of having to be escorted by a work experience kid and not being able to go at your own pace. Moreover the only place to take a photo is in front of a vivid mural on the stair case. Left on my own or with a guide who could answer the most basic of questions, this little museum could have been interesting. They have a programme of temporary exhibitions in one room which gave a more interesting insight, in my case into the guerrilla campaign in 1945 in Mindanao. On a hot day it is a cool refuge but the museo is not well sign posted."

"HanaCarrera ","Munich, Germany","April 17, 2017","A little warm, but very informative and well-kept!","I went here with my sister on March 2017. There is no entrance fee, and they even have guided tours in English for free! Our guide was an informative young woman wearing a hijab (this is the best way I could describe her since we did not catch her name). She covered everything there is to learn about Davao from pre-colonial times up to present. Picture-taking and camcording are restricted inside the exhibition rooms, but are allowed in the art gallery and with the big mosaic in the middle of the stairway. It was a nice way to spend a rainy afternoon, but it's not for little kids or those who have difficulty with using stairs."
"IchbinStego ","Manila, Philippines","February 28, 2017","a very interesting little Museum","I found the museum pretty interesting last year but the only problem I saw in the kind of rush that friendly lady wanted to push us through the rooms with its exhibits. Questions were not welcome at all. Also, the ""briefing"" and kind of menace, if I would take a photo inside, made me feel not really welcome. The guided tour was so fast that I had no time to look around. So I did ask for another round, but alone. I was allowed. Indeed a group that just started after us did overtake us with an even faster guide."

If I am being a bit picky there were several spelling errors on the sign but aside from that it is a good museum."

"AsanSiDiwaAtShiela ","Lapu Lapu, Philippines","January 10, 2015","It's free admission","Since it's free, don't expect too much... :) But even though it's free, there's always a tour guide who will educate you about Davao. If you love history, culture and arts, this is a place for you. :)"
"agigil ","Quezon City, Quezon City, Philippines","December 10, 2014","History preserved","I really appreciate that they're able to find out the history of the Dabawenyos. From the houses, the culture, the attire, the tools they use. Their tour guide is also very friendly."

"Capt Mark O ","Hong Kong","October 12, 2014","Go if you have spare time","The museum is neither good nor bad. It has most of the exhibits on the second floor. A lot of before and after pictures, and a lot of paintings by local artists. But it is not particularly interesting nor is it particularly informative about what Davao is now, or what its past was.  I think the building is newly built on top of what was the site of the Court of First Instance.  Go if you have extra time to spare, after the beach, wakeboarding, shopping in Aldevinco, or buying fruits in Bankerohan market.  Entrance is free.0900-1800H Mon-Fri. Call to make sure (082) 222-6011"
"Pam B ","Cebu City, Philippines","July 17, 2014","Great tour, plus it's free!","One of the best things about going to the Museo Dabawenyo is that it costs you nothing. Well, except for the fare to get you to and from the museum. We were greeted by a friendly staff who helped us with our heavy backpacks. We asked them if there was any entrance fee and they said there was none, you just had to log your name in the visitor's list. According to the museum guide, it was the only one in the Philippines that did not charge visitors.  The place is pretty packed with many cultural heritage and is a great learning place for those interested in Davao culture and history. It goes back through time, goes through its politics and there is also room for modern stuff like art.  It is probably the best museum visit I have ever had in my entire life. I hope to bring my daughter there again, when she is much older and could understand the guide."
"Liza A ","San Jose City","July 16, 2014","take pride of having a rich history and culture and traditions","We can glean the history and culture of the Davao's 10 recognized tribes and Muslims. Traditional attires and crafts are displayed, along with the snippets of culture and the way the royal clans and soldiers lived which have been immortalized through their artilleries and ornaments that dated back several decades ago."
"slyvargas ","Bacoor, Philippines","July 13, 2014","Dabaw","This museum is well-maintained. It seems to perceive good governance over the city. To travellers, get a glimpse of Dabawenyo history through the place."
"Melody T ","Davao City, Philippines","May 21, 2014","Worthy to go","It is free with air-conditioned rooms!!! It is worthy to go!! It is easy to go by a taxi because it is in the center of the city. If you go by driving, there are available parking spaces around that area."
"MelP160 ","makati","May 5, 2014","Accessible and Free of Charge","Its right in the center of the city proper and its free of charge. Drawback is that its only open Mondays to Fridays. The text in some areas are too long. But the section with the mannequins are cramped and do not have any text at all. So the presentation needs to be streamlined and made catchy."
"cristydti "," ","April 30, 2014","very impressive","I really love visiting museums everytime I travel and Davao has a very impressive museum...the house itself has wooden floors and according to the guide, it was a former courthouse.....every room has a story and every item is very interesting....."

Never knew that Bagobo have different tribes as well as the Muslim who populated the area long before. It exceeded my expectations. The art gallery is what I enjoyed a lot, especially the masterpieces who won the contests. "

" "," "," ","Very Small, But Interesting","A small, cultural museum. And the price is right: free.  Much of Davao's history is well displayed in this tiny museum.  A very good collection showing many aspects of Davao.  The free guide was knowledgeable and helpful.  Unfortunately she hustled us through very quickly, and we did not have enough time to view the interesting artifacts and read the (sometimes lengthy) accompanying stories.  Perhaps she feared that we would take photos that are allowed only in the lobby?  However, we will return to this tiny museum and spend more time on our next visit.  If you are into these kinds of anthropological displays, this little gem is worth a look-see."
"WanderLustDavao ","Davao City","October 7, 2013","A Must Visit for travellers","It may not be at par with other museums but Museo Dabawenyo has its own charm and ways of telling visitors the city's less known history. Philippine history is full of Luzon stories. Museo Dabawenyo will tell you the region and the city's evolution that can't be found in text books. Best of all, it's free/open to the public."
"Inanrehhernani ","Cebu, Philippines","October 3, 2013","It speaks of Dabaw","A must see for travellers who would want to know the history of the place. One would see the dreams and visions of the different tribal groups for Davao. There you would also know the accomplishments and feats of their leaders. Before going out to different places, drop by their and be grounded with their story"
"Wshkd ","Jackson Heights, New York","September 9, 2013","Excellent History of Davao","This small downtown museum is chock full of the history of Davao, its people, customs, heritage and government from inception to today. A small two story building with free admission. A museum guide will take you thru all the exhibits and give a detailed history and explanation of everything you see.  A must see if you want to know Davao and its heritage. Highly recommended. "

"shankaronline ","Pasig, Philippines","June 20, 2013","Good but too small","This is a fairly good museum though very small. It has two levels and exhibits a varied collection of artefacts, photos and models showing the evolution of Davao to its present time. Lighting could be better, as the middle portions of the halls are dark-ish, but the more than friendly guide made up for that with his excellent explanations. Of particular interest is a painting at the entrance made from spiky durian skin. Only things I didn't quite like were the lighting as I said earlier, the tiny premises and the fact that photography was not allowed at all inside the museum, even with out strobe.(flash)"
"mayapis ","manila","May 8, 2013","Information on Davao and its history not available anywhere but here!","For a museum run by the city government and with no admission fee, I was very pleasantly surprised to see how well organized it was and how well-informed our free tour guide Winnie was. Admittedly, it is small but there is enough content for a tourist to end up appreciating the city's history. I appreciated knowing more about the indigenous tribes, their culture and seeing a model of their dwellings. The city government should be congratulated for this beginning of a museum which Davao residents should be proud of and continue to support."

Very good guides show you around and inform you not only about the history of Davao City but also rural life of Mindanao ethincal tribes. Enjoyed and will come again some other time."

" "," "," ","nice and well maintained Museum","Well it was just our quick stop, we spent like maybe 30-45 minutes in the museum. I must say that the way they were able to preserve the historical items inside was impressive, they were doing a good job on that, and they must keep it up. the only thing I could comment on was the lady that was assigned to guide us inside the museum. she just walked us around instead of providing us the necessary information she just let us roam on our own and read and see the entire place. It could have been nicer if she was enthusiastic and informative."
