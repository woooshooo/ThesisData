What I like about this place it has a lot of huge trees around so its relaxing and breezy compared to the Rizal park near by.  It has a portion for kids play ground and a place for check / checkers players, there is also a place for seniors to hang out."

"Amy S"," ","November 8, 2017","OSMENA PARK FOR EVERYONE!","The park is a stroll away from shopping streets of San Pedro and Claro M. Recto. If one is not interested to shop, Osmena Park is a perfect place to go to while waiting for the other person who went shopping."

"Keno N","Davao City, Philippines","June 16, 2016","A few green places in downtown Davao","When we retired to Davao City 3 years ago, the Osmena Park was overrun by manicurists, old men playing chess, and a lot of people just milling around to spend the day. Now it has been converted to a park for Senior Citizens. It's landscape is always maintained and it is generally quiet. It is closed at night unlike before where residents nearby and the homeless would sleep the night because it was cool even then. So it makes for a green place to rest after a visit to the Davao Museum just across the street!"
