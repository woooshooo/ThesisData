"tsbSeattle","Seattle","March 11, 2018","Meh....sad to say, but over rated i think....","I really wanted to go here after reading other reviews, but other than pose for some pictures and a nice walk.... not much is here. I guess if you have small children this is the place to go and let them play, but I was bored in 5 minutes. So I guess a mixed feeling."
"leli G"," ","March 4, 2018","Cool place ","We visit people’s park at around 1-2PM when we went inside the place is cool. We stayed for a while and let our son play in the playground its nice that they have this kind of place in Davao where people can just relax. And its nice that they maintained the place so clean. "
"Amani C","Caloocan, Philippines","March 1, 2018","needs to be rennovated","Good for a morning or night walk but seems like the park has more to offer but not maintained well esp for the lights at night which I think they should have added more. Looks old and needs some upgrading. Though its for free, I believe because there's nothing to do there we haven't stayed for more than 20 mins. We just literally walk around to check it out."
"jwillierlanzon","Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia","February 1, 2018","Small park but well maintained, clean","This park is a great and secure place for people to walk and avoid the fumes of jeepneys in the streets of Davao. Smoking is not allowed inside and there is a checkpoint in the entrance wherein bringing cigarettes, lighters, tobacco (maybe vape as well) are strictly prohibited and enforced. Good place to jog in the morning or on sunset."

"travel_l_love","Vienna, Austria","January 21, 2018","Old and neglected beauty ","This place had certainly seen much better times and should get back in focus from local authorities because it's a beauty in its core.  It is obvious that maintenance badly failed, many points of interest are not on function anymore, dirty and damaged. The nature is amazing and despite the bad condition many people love to go there for relaxing, chatting and energizing. But its a dying beauty and needs to be missed awake with great efforts.  You don't have so many places to go in Davao City , so better take care of the here before it falls totally apart."

Filled with numerous statutes with which you could have your photo taken, the place is also an amusement park which will delight the young and the old alike. And finally, during weekend mornings, the park becomes an activity and sports center, where you could do some running or jogging. There is also a zumba session for those so inclined. Both are events which attracts many participants, both locals and tourists. I myself witnessed the zumba and the jogging during the Sunday morning that I visited.

"Polomolok, South Cotabato, Philippines","Polomolok, South Cotabato, Philippines","April 23, 2011","Relaxing place in the heart of the city","Though I have been to Davao many times but I never visited that place except for my last visit because a friend of mine insisted. The park was a child friendly. I love the rainbow color of the floor when you reach entrance. The sculpture of eagles and children playing was nice. People there, loved to sit and listen to the music played in the park.   They are strict with their security. You can't bring bottled water or a cigarette, lighter. You must leave it at the entrance and claim it when you decide to leave the park. Well, someone who is new to Davao must visit this place. Its just around the downtown, near to the restaurants and hospitals."
