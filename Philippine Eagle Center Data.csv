"small-skiing-mole","South East England","4 weeks ago","Plenty of eagles and other birds to see and informative film in a side room","I believe this place does great work, breeding and releasing into the wild. However, they don't highlight this fact unless you watch the short documentary in a side room and then speak to the staff there. After walking round, it just seemed like a nice little bird zoo rearing highly endangered captive eagles and some other eagles, kites and owls, but a staff member in the film room highlighed the work behind the scenes rearing birds away from human contact so that they can be released. PLEASE HIGHLIGHT YOUR CONSERVATION EFFORTS MORE PROMINENTLY!"
"Aljess L"," ","March 5, 2018","Worthy cause","Kudos to the Philippine Eagle Center for its work to propagate the Philippine national bird. Went there on a weekday, not that busy--no guide available as well. A visitor's center with a multimedia presentation would have helped further the cause.  The place was a bit run down and could use a little sprucing up. It was sad to see the lone croc in its tiny enclosure and few other animals in captivity (deer, warthogs, etc.)   Not a fan of zoos but a visit and donation to the center is all for a worthy cause.  P.S. Bring bug repellent, the mosquitoes were relentless!"
"mrneli4evr"," ","March 5, 2018","Endangered Species in Davao","Different Endangered Animals you can see here in Philippine Eagle Center but was neglected. The place was not well taking cared of. Sad to look at those Animals in dirty cages, trees uncut or well maintained. Entrance fees are very high cost - not worth it for what you will see inside. You will not enjoy touring inside or seeing those animals but you will feel sad unlike other Parks (for Animals) we've been to. I hope you can do better than that. Was not impressed. "
"Mhina1021","Pasig, Philippines","March 3, 2018","Soaring with the Eagles","And I'm not talking about Ateneo but the real thing. I encourage you to take time to visit this place when you're in Davao. A little educational trip on the side wont hurt. As our national bird is critically endangered together with the other endemic species, we need to spread awareness. But aside from that it was really amazing seeing them in person and to see how majestic these creatures are. "

More time travelling than the time actually spent there. Aside from the eagles held in captivity , there is also an owl and a crocodile. Since you are already there why not spend time buying souvenirs, trying the honey coated turon , and a photo op with a python. "

"looklikecris","Valenzuela, Philippines","January 24, 2018","A Sanctuary","A sanctuary for our national bird. But aside from eagle, we also had a close encounter with a huge crocodile, wild boars and monkeys. Compare from the other zoos I've been, animals here were almost close to their original habitat. But they are still in capture.   Entrance fee is 350 pesos for adults. It is pricey but we only think that it was a donation for this sanctuary because they really need our help for the conservation of our Philippine Eagles."

Although it is build with good intentions to help to sustain nature the cages for most of the beautiful creatures are far too small, the poor crocodile does not even have enough space to swim or dive. Only the massive KOJ Pond is ok. I felt such a pity for most of this beauties."

"Manila, Philippines","Manila, Philippines","December 31, 2017","Absolutely a must","Do not expect a zoo. The center is simple, but with the small resources available to them (entrance fee is low) they did an excellent job. The birds are impressive to see, and there are many of them. The forest setting is wonderfully fresh and shady, and there are a few other animals that can be enjoyed. There is not too much explanation though, one aspect that could be improved. For young children it may easily get boring - you are watching birds after all. But for those who have never seen one of these elegant and endangered birds before, I recommend a visit. Plus the center definitely serves a good cause."

If you are with a couple of others you can share a taxi, the only really sensible way to get there. From a nature point of view, I always thought the Australian wedged tail eagle and the American bald eagle were the biggest. So, it was a pleasant surprise to know that these magnificent birds are at the top of the tree.  It's reasonably nicely set out without being too commercial, opting for natural surroundings. There is food available, resting places and a few other animal species there. Crocodiles, monkeys, darn big pythons, a goat or two and an animal of which I took a photo but have no idea what it is. There were a couple of sea eagles and koi fish pond. All adding to the ambience. Here's a tip - don't eat lunch there. There is a restaurant not too far away called Mountain Top Restaurant. Magnificent views while eating your meal and the scenery makes for great photos."

"John Q"," ","May 11, 2017","Visit to the Philippine Eagle","A visit to the sanctuary of the endangered Philippine Eagle should be encouraged for Filipinos and bird lovers. The Philippine Eagle, the country's national bird, is one of the biggest birds of prey in the world with a wingspan of over 7 feet. It is also endangered with an estimate of less than a thousand in the wild. It is endemic to the Philippines only. The Sanctuary provides care for eaglets and wounded eagles in order to allow them to survive in the wild eventually. There are also other specie of birds in the sanctuary including hawks and owls as well a fauna such as deer, monkeys and wild boar. A visit to the sanctuary involves a walk-through along jungle paths. The walk-through is quite primitive but provides a more natural ambience to the visit. Best to bring raingear because it often rains in the vicinity being at the foothills of the Mt Apo mountain range although the sanctuary provides umbrellas to visitors."
"Ram_B1969","Cebu City, Philippines","May 6, 2017","Go There For The Eagles","The place was quite far if you're based in the city proper so try to save ample time for the road travel, and consider possible traffic. If you go there with the primary intention of seeing the eagles, then it's worth the trip. You'll see them close. Although it's still a pitiful sight to see some of them without a cage but then tied up. Made me think which one's better for the bird, to be in a cage but not tied up or out of cage yet tied. The plants and trees are so healthy and naturally beautiful. Bring your camera, wear comfortable shoes and prepare to walk on unpaved or partially paved path. Wear comfortable cool clothes and bring your hanky or small towel for your sweat. Apply a mosquito repellent so you'll have a comfortable time. The park's not that big and you'll be done in an hour or less, but for me it was a short yet full and enjoyable experience."

The signs posted were informative. It was sad, though, to see eagles tethered. I hope that they were put in aviaries or something at some point so they didn't have to just stand on poles.

While the center is supposedly being ran by scientists and experts on the field of eagle species conservation, the whole exhibit area never fascinated me. I'm not sure how we can make the eagles enjoy their stay while in captivity, while being experimented on for propagation? It's best to visit the Malagos Bird Sanctuary and Resort nearby and be enchanted with the welcoming committee of colorful talking parrots and other birds perched on each handler's shoulders. "

"flxmanuel","New York City, New York","April 30, 2016","emotional...","As a child, I have always been fascinated by the Philippine Eagle, from the time I saw one in captivity, I have longed to visit the Philippine Eagle Center in Davao.  A few days before my visit to the Philippine Eagle Center, news came out that “Pamana”, a Philippine Eagle released in the wild last June, was fatally shot in the protected area where she was released. It was devastating news for everyone involved in rescuing her before. A villager in Iligan found her in 2012 and was taken into the center and was treated for a gunshot and was released after undergoing rehabilitation. Despite attempts of the Philippine Eagle Foundation to educate people in protecting the endangered National Bird of the Philippines, there are still people who do not listen. There are less than five hundred Philippine Eagles in the wild today.    The Philippine Eagle Center in Davao is home to at least thirty Philippine Eagles. Most of them suffered from gunshot wounds. There were a lot of foreign volunteers at the center when I visited and it made me wonder why these people are more concerned in helping preserve our National Bird more than other Filipinos.   Among the eagles I saw, it was “Putol” who captured my attention. The eagle’s left wing was clipped by a bullet a few years ago. This eagle, who mightily spreads his broken wing reminds me of how resilient most Filipinos are. I was awed by the beauty and pride this eagle had. I just wish more people would take care of the flora and fauna that we have. I am grateful that people at the Philippine Eagle Center and Philippine Eagle Foundation have devoted their time and effort to give the Philippine Eagle a fighting chance to survive.  The Philippine Eagle Foundation firmly believes that the fate of our vanishing Philippine Eagle, the health of our environment, and the quality of Philippine life are inextricably linked. We are therefore committed to promote the survival of the Philippine Eagle, the biodiversity it represents, and the sustainable use of our forest resources for future generations to enjoy.  The Center is home to 36 Philippine Eagles, 18 of which are captive-bred. It also houses 10 other species of birds, 4 species of mammals and 2 species of reptiles. Simulating a tropical rain forest environment, the Center offers the visitor a glimpse into the country’s forest ecosystem. Although the exhibits are used primarily to help educate the Filipino people on conservation, the facility is also considered a major tourist attraction in Davao City.  You can help save our Philippine Eagle in various ways. Visit the Philippine Eagle Foundation website for more information."

"al22tecc","philippines","January 1, 2016","worth the trip","The center is located inside another park, where you need to pay a small entrance fee. The entrance fee to the center is now at P150.  The center explains how much they spend for the animals' food. I wonder if the entrance fee we pay is enough. The majestic philippine eagles are the highlight. There are other eagles and birds inside but its still the philippine eagle that is the main attraction. What adds to the interest is that these eagles are adopted by different institutions and some of them are quite popular. It is also nice to see the signages that explains when they were born, and who were the birds' parents. Some birds are tied down and not caged, but these are the ones whose wings were damaged and could not fly. However, these birds have adapted and are quite a ramp model, more than willing to strike a pose. However, they only follow their handlers. When we tried to say the same words, no reaction! Try to get a guide to bring you around the place. If none is available, if you see one around, try to tag along. The interaction that these handlers do with the eagles are a sight to see in itself.  There were huge, lush trees and greens all over. However, this also means a lot of mosquitos when 3 or 4pm comes in."

Took us 30 minutes from airport to go there, our driver knew local road. Traffic was really really bad, one motorcycle driver died in front of us, was hit by truck so local politician should stop bsing about smoking and fire crackers and pay attention to real problems.

Affordable entry fee ($0.10 per person to the grounds plus $3.20 per person to see the animals) but definitely not contributing much to the upkeep. Need to rethink how to make it a more dynamic operation capable of so much more.

The road going to the center is well-paved but the maximum speed is only 60kph so you might need to consider that if you are managing your sched.  Upon arrival, you will need to pay a Php5 entrance free to enter the Davao Water District then another Php100 for the PEC itself.  Sad to say that the place is not well-maintained so wear pants or long-sleeves, or prepare to use your OFF lotion as there are lots of mosquitos. They are also selling citronella products in their gift shop if you came unprepared(like us).  You could see different kinds of eagles. Some in cages, some out in the open(with a rope tied on their feet). Some cages are empty though.  They have a koi pond near the lobby but you could barely see the fishes as the water is murky.  To sum up, you can alot 20 to 30mins here then move on to your next activity.

Then you have to pay to get into the Eagle Park itself.   The reception and cafe area also leaves a lot to be desired. It basically needs a good clean and a refresh. There is no indoor aircon area either.  The park is set in tropical grounds and the walk is interesting due to the variety of flora. The range of birds is also good, although it is a shame that some of them are in smallish cages.  The Philippine eagles are amazing, and have a real presence.

"itoy_MNL","Manila, Philippines","June 20, 2014","Its nice to see the Philippine Eagle... that's it...","We went to Davao for a vacation and planned to include the PEC on our last day itinerary.  It is easily accessible from downtown Davao. Just go to the Annil Bus Terminal located at the corner of San Pedro and Quirino Streets. The fare for air-conditioned bus from Davao City to Calinan is 45 pesos. Upon arriving at the Calinan Bus Terminal, there are tricycles waiting which goes directly to the Philippine Eagle Center (10 pesos fare per person if sharing the ride with other passengers). The total travel time is about an hour, shorter time if you travel by car.  We checked the website of PEC prior to our visit, where it is indicated that there are tour guides who will assist you for free. Upon paying for our entrance tickets, we saw a group of tour guides sitting at a table merrily chatting and ignoring us even if its obvious that we were there as local tourists. Then a group of foreigners arrived, and they eagerly approached and volunteered to tour the foreign guests around. ITS A COMPLETE SHAME THAT THESE TOUR GUIDES ARE DISCRIMINATING FELLOW FILIPINOS. -calling the attention of PEC Management.  We had no choice but to wander around on our own. The place is filled with lush vegetation, more like a jungle-type of atmosphere where you will see huge trees and wild flowers blooming. We had a glimpse of different bird and animal species aside from the Philippine Eagle. Its too bad that the famous eagle named ""Pag-asa"" is in a huge cage located on the upper part of the center and is currently not accessible due to some maintenance on-going.   Be careful while walking around because there are small insects which flies directly to your eyes, I got about four of them and my companion had three stuck in our eyes. Carefully pick them out as you might end up having pieces of these insects in your eyes if you just scratch your eyes with the insect in it. Better to wear your eyeglasses or shades or perhaps swimming goggles for kids ;-) it looks dumb but its better than having your visit ruined by insects stucked in your eyes.  There's a free toilet located near the ticket counter, along with the PEC souvenir shop and snack center.   Overall, the Philippine Eagle Center is worth a visit to see the Philippine's famous eagle.   IMPORTANT REMINDER: There's a man selling ""driftwood"" carving of the holy family outside the Center. It looks good and he explained to us that its worth the 1,200 pesos price tag because its an authentic wood carving from the nearby penal colony. We haggled for 600 pesos but ended up paying 700 pesos. Upon returning to Manila, we found out that the outer frame is genuine driftwood, but the sculpture itself is just molded from plaster of paris. Another shameful act of dishonesty from fellow Filipinos. :-(  The gift shops lined up outside the PEC sells more expensive goods. Better save your money and proceed to Aldevinco Shopping Center in downtown Davao. I bought batik shawls there for 180 pesos and you can get better design and quality from Aldevinco for as low as 150 pesos."

"Screaming_Pen","Davao City, Philippines","May 27, 2014","A good spot to enjoy nature","The Philippine Eagle Centre is one of the best tourist spots in Davao City even before when I was young. It houses the great Monkey-eating eagle which is arguably one of the largest eagles in the world.   However, there are some noticeable changes that needs immediate attention for further improvement of the area. 1. the cleanliness - the area must be kept clean at all times. Since most of the tourists there are nature-tripping, they really cannot appreciate litter. Garbage bins were full and there were some areas were very untidy.  2. price increase - the adult / child entrance fees of 100 / 50 would in my opinion, discourage local tourists to visit because it is somewhat costly. However, if the fee would benefit the animals in the centre then I may agree to the agree to the price increase (effective June 4, 2014) 3. predicament of the animals - As I have observed some cages of the animals lacked maintenance like cleaning, and pruning the weeds that engulfed the big cages. Maybe they should at least clean it once in a while.  If these three would be addressed, I think the centre will still be a great tourist icon in Davao City for many years to come. PLEASE DO ADDRESS THE ISSUES I HAVE RAISE. Not for me, but for the benefit of the next generation.   Tip: Look for handlers around the center that would provide opportunities for you to have a closer picture or even hold the eagles."

"Manila, Philippines","Manila, Philippines","February 23, 2014","Informative but needs improvement","As someone who advocates life, I am thankful for this institution's endeavor to protect the Philippine eagle. However, as someone who's been to other aviaries, I would say that this place needs a lot of improvement. Well, considering the cheap entrance fee, I can see why the state of the park is like so, but if it's to protect this endangered species and to promote awareness about it, I would be willing to pay more just to uplift this aviary.  In terms of the flora, it is very abundant, and it also includes some other fauna that is endemic in the country. I also like how there are informative boards and trivia about different sub- species of eagles. I like how they are focused more on what's endemic in the country as well.  There are things that need improvement. For one, the museum's displays are obviously not taken care of properly. The stuffed animals have collected dust and some have been stored away probably because the environment in the museum is not controlled. Another thing is that the birds are chained. I know that this is to prevent the people from getting hurt, but another thing that can be done I think is to put a glass walkway or a cage walkway for people so that they can observe the birds fly freely. Some parts of the aviary specifically the wires are also not maintained. From the people I was with who've been there before, they also noted a considerably fewer number of birds. I think there is lack of funding in terms of breeding these birds and probably the lack of zookeepers.  To end, the place is worth a visit to get to know these endemic eagles more. It will help them raise funds to protect these animals as well as to repopulate them. However, don't expect an ideal aviary seeing as it needs further improvement. There are stalls for donations though, so hopefully many will be able to help."

I hope they can have a hotline so people can inquire. From what I saw you can take pictures with the eagle up close.

The Center itself is rather small and some of the (eagle) cages were empty when we visited.  There's a sign at the entrance saying that one ticket supports 20% of the daily expenses of keeping an eagle alive so that's a good enough reason to go given that this is a critically endangered species. Thanks to the Foundation for the work it does.   To make this trip worth it (especially for kids), best to go to Malagos Garden right after visiting the Eagle Center."

"ImmerWandern","Palos Heights, Illinois","July 16, 2012","Very educational visit","The Philippine Eagle Center lies about an hours drive outside Davao City proper. The purpose of this institution is multifaceted but its main thrust seems to be educational; visitors will not only see the Philippine national bird up close but several other raptors endemic to the archipelago. The tour guide will emphasize the loss of natural habitat as well as hunting in the decline of these magnificent creatures. The center also offers ""Keeper Talks"" where the caretakers of specific species of eagles give more detailed presentations of their wards; unfortunately we did not make it to any of these talks and took only the general tour.  The Center cares for injured raptors, conducts field research, and engages in breeding programs.  There was a pond with an estuarine crocodile wallowing in the water. Another area featured Philippine macaques. Our guide pointed out a far-off tree where fruit bats were roosting.  It was both inspiring and depressing to encounter the eagles under these conditions. Most of the cages were small and even the largest enclosures would not have let the eagles do more than perhaps glide a short distance. We never witnessed any eagle fly. Some eagles were wounded and were no longer able to fly; they would not have survived in the wild anyway. One can only hope that the work they do does help preserve the Philippine Eagle and its other brethren.   In addition to the Philippine Eagle, we also saw Grass owls, White-bellied sea eagles, Brahminy Kites, Philippine serpent eagles and the Philippine eagle-hawk or Pinsker's Hawk.  One reviewer mentioned the leaves, twigs, and slippery walkways. Understand that the Center is in a tropical rain forest and the forest canopy is constantly shedding material which drops to the ground to either become fodder for animals or turn into topsoil. Perhaps the staff could sweep more frequently but totally clean paths may be too much to expect. It is a rain forest so the paths will be slippery; in fact our visit was interrupted by heavy rain showers. I do agree, however, that the signage needs updating. I am not sure how accessible the Eagle Center would for guests using wheelchairs; certainly some of the paths would seem to be extremely difficult to negotiate in a wheelchair. I would like to see larger bird enclosures - perhaps extensive netting covering several trees - for those raptors that were still capable of flight. I can only imagine what ii must look like to see one of them soar overhead.  The visit is worth the entrance price and the effort to go there. Be prepared for a jungle walk; this is not a sanitized zoo environment. Consider bringing binoculars to get a closer look at some of the eagles in their enclosures, though this is not absolutely needed. Ask the staff and guides for specific actions you can take as individuals to help make the survival of these eagles more likely."
"kdsmithjr","ithaca, ny","July 12, 2012","A great place to spend a quiet yet educational afternoon. The kids will love it too.","This is a park/research center and it is well done. The landscaping is good and there is no commercial feel at all. Even the on-site sovenirs are reasonably priced and the proceeds go to help the animals. The place is not really easily accesible by bus, so be prepared to hire a driver/taxi...and negotiate the price before because it can vary widely. Best to take a local with you to do things like get a good price to come and go.Lots of competition at malls like SM Plaza, so you might get a good deal from there to the center and back....and be dropped off at good shopping and eating at the end."
