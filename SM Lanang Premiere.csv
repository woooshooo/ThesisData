"defyeo","Davao City","1 week ago","Destination mall in Mindanao","This mall has complete amenities. Good to hangout with the entire family. The mall have several large format stores such as Uniqlo, Forever 21, Terranova, Marks and Spencer, Sports Central, Ace Hardware, Department Store and Supermarket. The mall also has several amenities such as IMAX, Bowling, Fountain, SMX Convention center, Park Inn Hotel, Foodhall and Digital cinemas.   This mall also has complete dining options to choose from.   Overall I find this mall to be the finest mall in Davao.

"xheroine1981","Davao City, Philippines","February 22, 2018","Can be called Food Mall","Too many restaurants, stalls and cafes you can see here.. from fast food to dining. You can select cuisines like local (Davao's best), Filipino, Asian, Indians, Middle Eastern, European, Western, Japanese, Chinese, Koreans and a lot more Aside from it, the mall also offers movie house, supermarket, pharmacy, department store, fun land, some branded names, phone accessories, convention center, parking space, bank office (BDO)"
"looklikecris","Valenzuela, Philippines","January 24, 2018","Surprisingly huge","We went here on a Sunday and also Christmas season. But I was surprise it was not that crowded as I expected. Upon entrance, you will realize that it was really huge.The name premier was really fit for this mall.  We just took a jeep going here and we took a cab going out. For a traveler just like us, it was really easy to commute coming here."
"Tony_King_Jr","Davao City, Philippines","December 8, 2017","Visit for Weekend Food Park","The place is very accessible especially for me that I just work near the area. It is a must visit every time there is a Weekend Food Park in their parking lot area. There are a lot of shops and stores to choose from inside. I just noticed in the department store that SM Eco has updated stocks than the Sm Lanang."
"lionlamica","Florida","November 7, 2017","Alot of nice stores","Nice place to walk around and shop on a hot day. Most stores have reasonable prices and there are a few that are expensive like in the US. The strange thing is the sizes are very small. I tried on a pair of shorts I liked and they would not even go over my legs and they were XL. Maybe I was in the wrong section I don't know but if you buy clothes I would recommend you try on first."
"ToujoursLaRoute","Iasi, Romania","October 16, 2017","Best place for shopping in Davao","Quite impressive mall, with a convenient access directly from the Radisson Park Hotel. Try to find the local products, there is a stand in the supermarket and also an entire shop at the same level (-2). Plenty of choices in terms of electronics...and also the usual brands. Very securized place."
"blessie","New Zealand","October 15, 2017","Love this Mall!","This is my favourite shopping mall in Davao. Everything I want is here - from restaurants to cafes and department stores. It is very handy to Park Inn by Radisson and the walk bridge from the hotel to the mall is an excellent idea. I love the variety of shops - from high end boutiques to mid-ranged ones. I also love the fact that every time I visit there are new shops, new spas, new restaurants, etc. For me, this place just caters for all that I want in a shopping mall."

"MsDumaring"," ","February 11, 2017","Many things in one place","I attended a meeting at the SMX Conference Centre, which really is inside the SM Lanang Premier mall. This mall has many of the high street brands from clothings, book store, restaurants and cafes, a supermarket as well as manicure and pedicure shops. There is also a souvenir shop inside the mall, called ""Kultura"". Items sold vary from t-shirts, hats, bags, pouches, magnets, dried mangoes, chocolates, beauty products, pearls and many more. Prices are affordable although if you go to the markets you can stretch your peso more. "
"Irene F"," ","February 5, 2017","convention center galore","davao has been a must-see city in southern philippines, particularly in the island of mindanao. it boasts of several natural premier spots as well as man-made tourist hubs. sm lanang is one of the latter.  when we held a convention here a year ago, we didn't encounter any problem during the whole duration of the event. with state-of-the-art facility and spacious function halls, SM managed it smoothly and efficiently. and the participants could freely roam around the mall right after the affair.   truly, SM got it all!

"Victorianlad","Melbourne, Australia","January 28, 2017","Quite good mall","This shopping centre has three levels and unlike some others quite a good level of natural light inside as there is a sort of atrium.  The SM Department store is not huge but is on two levels.  The SM supermarket is very big but at 1100 on a Saturday had many cashier booths unstaffed.  Much of the food seemed to be either outside - so that after hours dining was possible - or on the third floor (meaning a lift or escalator trip.)  Aircon worked fairly well.  Taxis and jeepnets were well arranged outside with no waiting."
"Cathy H"," ","January 26, 2017","Classy and big!","Well not really big in size but the interior makes it look like it's really wide and it's refreshing to see and shop by! The place is not too crowded and they have SMX Convention there. It is like the SM Aura in Manila because it is that grand. "
"DonDan16","Hamburg, Germany","January 18, 2017","For me THE mall in Davao","SM Lanang is at least for me the place where I find almost everything. The usual mall things of course like supermarket, department store, small electronics, clothes. Many things to eat inside and outside. My all time favorite is the Hukad restaurant of course.  One nice thing is the water illumination in the evening. Best viewed from second floor.  Of course everything including the Toilets is clean.  Very important also for me is the laundry service, you find it at the floor below the ground floor.  And even more important for me as a man, we love it non complicated. This mall is so easy to understand, no hidden things, great. "
"Ajie A"," ","January 16, 2017","Last stop before leaving davao","This mall is usually our last stop. We shop at their supermarket which is almost complete - from local to imported items. I can find here almost all i need for our coffee shop business. The mall is spacious, with high end shops. But sometimes, if i need to buy clothing and shoes, this is not the place. "
"Leo E","Cagayan de Oro, Cagayan de Oro, Philippines","January 14, 2017","Premiere Convention Center","We attended a church activity at Davao City, Mindanao Regional Conference, all the way from Cagayan de Oro City. It was a 2-day affair held at SMX Convention Center of SM Lanang Premier. I was mesmerized at the vastness of the complex. Imagine the SMX alone contained around 5,000 people more or less, what with the praising and singing worship songs plus the dancing... with the words of God that you received as they were delivered by different speakers/preachers, we sure did had a good time. And no other venue can compliment to the occasion than the huge convention center.  Dining is not a problem as an array of restaurants, fastfoods, delis, food stalls and all that you can imagine are readily there waiting for everyone. Comfort rooms are aplenty, with wider spaces and large cubicles and more in numbers, I've got no problem at all!   Parking area is so large you can get lost if you are not observant enough. They also have a place for souvenir picture taking at the back portion of the ground level.   Roaming around the large edifice makes you feel like a tourist in your own country as the ambiance is special, euphoric and satisfying. Great place, really! Congrats to the Sys!!!"
"backpackingfoodieph","Cainta, Philippines","December 9, 2016","One of the Prime","SM Lanang could be one of the prime malls of SM Supermalls. It has big open ground floor. When we went there in June 2016, there's a Food Fest activity happening. There's a cooking competition, Cake design competition, some food free taste. On the same weekend of the event, there's also Food Expo happening in the Hall at the 2nd flr. We were able to get in but before we do, we have to signup first. The shops available in SM Lanang are from low-end to high-end brands.   Since our flight is in the evening, we were still able find time to watch movie. We watched the Lights Out, people inside are majority of teenagers. The crown are very loud and it made me irritated and frustrated. The people teens inside are very noisy, it seems that they come inside the movie house just to chat with each other and not to watch the movie. I wasn't able to control my temper so I yelled too loud for them to keep quiet. However, they didn't stop and it just made me look stupid.Good thing the lights are off and no one seen me. hahaha!   Overall, my visit in SM Lanang Premier didn't ruin that moment from the cinema. I like the mall's environment, it feels like I'm still in manila inside."
"Dave H"," ","December 5, 2016","Good shopping Mall","A nice big shopping mall, clean and very tidy, with plenty of places to eat, always go shopping here when in Davao"
"Dan Michael F"," ","November 20, 2016","One of best","We came by here before ending our Samal Island trip to shop. The mall is big and beautiful. They have many shops to choose from. As one of highlighted malls in Davao, they also have a convention area where many big events are held. If you have enough money for shopping, you may find the thing you needed. It takes time to round the place but it will be worthed. Accesible because it is situated near the highway."
"MikeInWyoming","General Santos, Philippines","November 11, 2016","One of many, it depends on where in Davao you are at the moment.","Davao is a large city with significant traffic problems. And so where I shop is as much determined by where I am as by anything else. SM Lanang is on the ""outskirts,"" by one measure, but it is on one of the most congested roads in all of Davao by another. If I am going to be visiting the Bureau of Immigration, that's where I will go. Abreeza, (a Robinson's) Mall is not too far away and probably just as good in my opinion.   If I am visiting my daughter, who is at Ateneo de Davao University, her apartment is far closer to SM City Mall in Ecoland.   I find parking is better at SM Lanang. The parking an SM City is just weird. But crossing the traffic to either get to, or leave, SM Lanang, as there is no traffic light is for me beyond frustrating.   All SM Malls I have been in, are well maintained, and nice places. The stores in all of them are targeted to those with larger budgets, in comparison to the Gaisano Malls or the old Victoria Mall in Davao.   Many of the stores I find in one SM Mall, I find in most of the rest. And if I am on the other side of the city, I will go to the NCCC Mall rather than any SM which is next door the S&R, a store over much like Costco in the US and has much I can't get anywhere else. Lanang is far from that.   It can take an hour to get from S&R to SM Lanang. Like I said in the beginning. Choosing a mall is more a matter of where you are when you start."

This is because SM still is the most customer friendly mall for me.anywhere I go (except for SM MOA).  Davao has two SM Malls. I choose Lanang. It is not crowded and has all the stores that I need. For a frequent traveller, it is the most convenient and the lay-out is easy to understand. It is hard to get lost in an SM Mall. You can always find your way without asking anyone. And SM Lanang is no different.  I would always get lost in other malls. But Lanang is convenient and it is easy to get a taxi. "

It's a more suburban part, Lanang, and the place is such a charm.   This SM mall boasts of space and the design is non obtrusive even if you have kiosks at the ground floor.   Don't come here looking for a food court serving local food. You have the usual local chains at the top floor or step out at the garden dining area and explore the casual dining offerings of Davao City.   Less crowded, too, if you frequent Metro Manila SM malls. I love it. "
"michael l"," ","July 26, 2016","Just your average mall","I'm not sure of the criteria for reviewing a mall, but by any standard this is an anodyne, clean, fairly sterile shopping plaza. It's architecturally undistinguished, and the store offerings are largely middle of the road; no high end designers, no fancy boutiques, and nothing to attract the eye or wallet of the rabid recreational shopper. Succinctly, it's big, it's bland, and it's entirely average in all respects. "

There is a big open space inside the mall and there are numerous seats for people to seat and relax. One thing struck me is when you ride on a taxi, there is a watcher who issues you a ticket indicating the date you rode & plate # & company name of the taxi. This is to enable you to call them in case you left something or for you to complain or complement about the taxi driver."

"MejoBadBoy","Las Pinas, Philippines","May 14, 2015","Not your typical mall..","Since I live in Manila, I am used with the other SM malls in Metro Manila area. This is a huge mall with IMAX theater and SMX Convention Center as well which is all located inside the mall. No self-served touch screen map to help you look for the store or restaurant you are looking for and you have to run after the guards just to ask where is where. The sad part about it is that the guards only speak ""Bisaya"" only. I tried asking them in tagalog but they responded back in ""Bisaya"" making me feel like an idiot figuring out what they are saying and just rely on their gestures where's the store I was looking for in the Mall. Piece of advice, BRING A MAP of this MALL or better yet a GPS to help you navigate inside the mall. "

The water display in the evenings is a wonderful watch. A nice combo of indoor & outdoor shopping/eating. Recommended."
"Peter S","Tasmania, Australia","May 3, 2015","WOW","One of the newer malls in Davao it truly has the WOW factor. ^ floors lots of space and selling to a wider customer range. This ,mall is very popular and is close to most hotels and the airport. Staff are friendly and take pride in their what they do. and like most in this region is immaculately kept. a real pleasure to visit."
"Jeff Y","Makati, Philippines","April 22, 2015","SM Lanang is worth visiting","This modern and big (by provincial standards) mall of SM in Lanang, Davao City is like any typical SM mall- lots of stores and restaurants. But unlike other SM malls, it seems more spacious and not as crammed as their other SM malls. There is a nice Starbucks outlet which seems suspended in between 2 floors. A restaurant row facing the nearby Radisson Hotel (complete with a connecting walk-way) makes for good eating. Lots of parking and along the main road. Quite nice and a good way to spend a lazy afternoon."
"slazenger552","Davao City, Philippines","April 14, 2015","Nice place to stroll with friends and family","This mall is so big and it has good amenities. It's also good for friends and family to come and shop. The SMX convention center is also good for conventions, concerts and other big events. The place is refreshing and relaxing, especially at the garden with fountain at the back side, during night time."
"fcl2929","Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia","March 8, 2015","Huge Complex, Newly Open, Interesting, WiFi","I stay at Crown Regency Hotel which is about 10 mins taxi ride away from SM Lanang Shopping Mall, that cost me Php 70 per way.  Taxi driver recommended to me this is better, usually I always trust the local taxi. Once arrived at lobby, body search by guard as usual in Philippines, walk inside, one is greeted by the huge expansive and can see 4 to 5 floors link by escalator.   Varieties of outlet selling clothes, electronic, food and many more. There wasn't really crowd probably it is due to it is still new and many shop under renovation.   There are plenty of food outlet on the 3rd Floor, western, locals. There is SMX Exhibition Hall also.  The surprise is that, the WiFi is working and quite effective probably due to lesser crowd, hope this is not the case.  I surely will cone back to SM Lanang whenever I travel to Davao Phillipines."

The only thing they dont dispose of the liners. The whole day each and every customer shares the same basket liner that becomes rather disgusting as the day proceeds. People are eating their cakes as they wait in line to pay Kids dirty hands are on the pastries, etc. etc, and the droppings are not removed and are there for you when you put your cakes etc. on the same liner. HELLO, they are disposable cheap paper, throw them out after each use. Stop trying to save money over hygiene."
"saf7670","Peterborough, United Kingdom","February 6, 2015","Standard SM Mall in Davao","3 levels of shops restaurants including cinema and bowing in Lanang, Davao. The shops are generally the same as found in SM stores throughout the Philippines. SM Lanang has however an outdoor range of upmarket restaurants which provide excellent western style meals. The mall also has a musical light/ water fountain show in the evenings. If you are passing through Davao SM is a great place to spend a few hours."
"Samy N"," ","November 20, 2014","Huge Mall to spend full day.","all excellent brands many restaurants and adult entertainments and kiddie entertainment, huge mall, so when you visit Samal island resorts you must go for a refreshment visit to SM Lanang, will take you back to Urban life again."
"Xanerin","Alice Springs, Australia","November 7, 2014","Big lot of nothing","This mall is huge and reminds me of many malls in Australia. No character - shops around the outside with the open space in the middle with nothing. So much could be done to improve this space - suggest a huge carousel for the patrons and this would certainly add more appeal. There was a jumping castle on the lower ground floor which was squeezed in - not tied down - poor effort. The only thing this mall has going for it is the restaurants - Vikings, Hogs Breath, and the usual. Feel I had visited a hospital rather than a mall, however excellent toilets!"
"marie032013","West Kirby, United Kingdom","October 21, 2014","not worth the money","I have been in Bench Fix Salon in Sm Lanang during my holiday. I requested for hot oil treatment. The staff gave me a ""power dose"" which consisted of cream applied on my hair and covered it with a cellophane. I asked why they did not do the usual hair steaming and the staff replied that it is only available for hair spa. It was the first time that I had a hot oil treatment without the ""hair steam"". I would not recommend it and its not worth paying 850 pesos."

"blessie","New Zealand","August 29, 2014","Love the fountain court","Another SM mall that cannot be missed. The attraction here is quite different from SM City in that this mall has a fountain reputed to be the largest in the Philippines. The water fountain puts on a great light show every night, every hour starting from 4 p.m. As for the mall, the shops are mostly the ""branded"" varieties, so prices can be a bit steep if you are paying in Philippine pesos. If you convert it to dollars, then it's still cheap. The mall does not have the same foot traffic as SM City so it doesn't really get that crowded. There is also always something going on in the Atrium - could be an exhibit or a nightly show. The basement houses hair salons and other places where you can have your nails or eyebrows done. It also has service centers where you can pay your utility bills. As for eating places, go to the top floor, and the choices are quite a few - all reasonable priced. For the record - cafes and restaurant inside the mall are cheaper than those outside the mall or those facing the Fountain Court."
"Liezel G","Davao del Sur Province, Philippines","August 8, 2014","Biggest mall in Davao","This is the biggest mall in the City! They have the first Vikings Restaurant in Davao. The place is huge, I love the idea that I can still get sunlight from the inside specially at the atrium. The have a fountain court that is very nice during the night!"

"MijnlieverdFH","Amsterdam","July 3, 2014","Convenient for those coming from the north.","Coming from Davao del Norte, SM Lanang is just the right place for a stop. It is also so close to Swiss Deli, though there are also good restaurants inside.   The needed items can be mostly found here from high-end stuffs to practical needs. My husband chose to have his hair-cut here as well. Parking is not a problem. It has wider area for cars. Very convenient from parking to the various levels of the Mall through a two-way escalator from there.  Love to be here too."
"Ecyor","Manila","May 2, 2014","Wow!!! Was all I could say","From the title of my review, i was simply amazed with what I saw. Way back in 2010, there was only SM Ecoland and now in 2014 when I came back, they have this. Kinda far from the city proper and near the airport, this place is still accessible.  It actually reminds me of a crossbreed between SM North Edsa and SM MOA."

They have a wide variety of stores for anyone's shopping pleasure. They also have a wide variety of places to eat if you get hungry. Very clean and well kept mall. Would definitely recommend this mall if you love shopping and are not on a budget."
"TinaCasey0423","Pasig, Philippines","December 4, 2013","One of the biggest malls in the Philippines, down south","SM Lanang Premier is just like the twin sister of SM Mall of Asia in Manila. It offers a spacious mall area lined up with stores from both international and local brands. SMX Convention Center is located at the 3rd floor of the mall, spacious area good for conventions, concerts, corporate events and other big functions. I consider this as one of the world class malls in the Philippines, next to SM Mall of Asia."
"davaocityguide","Davao City","October 7, 2013","Biggest Mall in the Philippines' Biggest City","There's just so much space in this mall. Whether shopping, dining, or just lounging around, it's quite enjoyable spending time in this one of a kind mall, spacious, very clean mall. Kind of reminds me of Singapore malls -- generous spaces, and good quality but affordable brands. One wouldn't think this mall in a province in the Philippines, but it is!"
"Gordonchef","Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","September 4, 2013","Bowling lane sub standard. theaters ok. mall is so so","Nothing special about this mall. Just like any other malls. Having over prices stores that no one buys. Nice free a/c. The water/light shows makes it sad.. I guess for davao standards its something to look at but if you seen Bellagio or Hong kong disneyland for kids water park, this makes it look like a water hose and some flashlights.. Bowling lanes are shorter than standard lanes and they oil every inch so actually bowlers that spin the ball , there is no traction. Movie theaters are like any other newer malls in davao. The IMAX is here a JOKE, its not 180 degree screen more like 90... 3d effects are mediocre at best. At least they have some decent resto here."

"DSnoopyGirl"," ","April 3, 2013","SM's Premier Mall in the South","SM's extensive experience in the business of Malls is evident in their construction and management of SM Lanang.  Located in a place which was not conventionally a place for commercial shopping, they have, once again, successfully created a ""supply"" not dependent on the ""need"". It boasts of a good number of familiar shops and services that you can find in the capital of the Philippines, which is a real comfort for people from the Metro visiting Davao. Parking is not a problem. I also noticed a very efficient cab-queuing process that was quick and safe. The main Atrium was big and the high ceilings of the mall made this area look even more spacious. The security guards were quite familiar with the location of the shops. Aircon was cold enough to cool the huge mall."
"pinayads","Cainta, Philippines","April 3, 2013","One-Stop Destination for Shopping, Dining, Entertainment and So Much More","One of the best malls I've ever been to! I was really awed by the place. It so spacious. The mall's exterior design is inspired by origami, the traditional Japanese art of paper folding. The abstract and asymmetric lines of the origami are introduced in the mall's the north, south and west facades.   SM Lanang Premier is targeted towards the higher segment of the market, no wonder it belongs to the crème de la crème of SM malls.   I love its Flat Café where Starbucks is designed on top of a free-standing slab that offers a 360-degree view of the monumental atrium.  Tenants/Mall staff are very friendly and helpful."
