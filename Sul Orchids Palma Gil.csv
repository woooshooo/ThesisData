Very nice, i didn't buy orchids but bought Staghorn ferns instead. Place smells like pesticide though because they just sprayed. If I knew they were spraying that day, I wouldn't have gone."
"Asia A","Narra, Philippines","May 11, 2016","Absolutely Beautiful","You have to appreciate nature's natural beauty to enjoy these magnificent and colorful orchids. I could have spent hours there looking at and photographing the orchids. No explanation was needed by the guide through the nursery as beauty needs no explanation.  The display area is filled with different varieties, artwork and sculpture. On your walk through the growing area there are orchids as far as the eye can see.   If you love nature, beauty and color...then take the time to visit."

But they need to have a guide who can explain what the farm is about, about orchids and its contribution to the city. It could have been a better experience."
