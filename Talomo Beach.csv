"ingmar b","Davao City, Philippines","November 8, 2015","Do not swim over here","the beach is nice for a stroll or catching a disease. the reason is the sewer just comes into the water over here. there are great resorts though with their own swimmingpool and nice restaurants with a nice see breeze"
"Telai J","Davao City, Philippines","June 3, 2013","Unclean","The beach is not clean! There are so many garbage littering the shoreline as well as the beach! It's quite near the river (and probably the sewage exits). Plus the beach is ""trench-y"". It has a steep slope, and can get very deep after only a few feet, and then it rises back up again. The waves can also get very strong, so if you're going with children, better be very careful.  there are lots of resorts around the beach. but if you can, opt out of it and go to Samal instead."
