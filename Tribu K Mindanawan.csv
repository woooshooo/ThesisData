"looklikecris","Valenzuela, Philippines","Reviewed January 24, 2018 ","I thought we were out of the country","It is my first time to visit Mindanao and I was so impressed with their culture. It felt like I was not in the Philippines.   We missed to see the Fireshow because of the rain but the cultural show was enough to keep us entertain. This is a must if you will visit Davao.   You must come here 30 minutes before the show starts, the place was just small and really crowded during the show. So you can get a good spot."
"vmdr90","Cagayan de Oro, Philippines","Reviewed November 11, 2017 ","On Fire","Witness some awesome Fire Dancing and Tribal songs and Dances performed by the Tribu K Mindanawan . Filipinos can will be able to have a deeper appreciation our culture afterwards. Very recommended for foreigners too."

"Ronnarie","Manila, Philippines","Reviewed October 25, 2017 ","Best fireshow everrr!","Goosebumps everytime I watched the show! This is one of the highlights of Davao tour, so never ever miss this. Awesome peeps, will never get tired of you."
"Hykes D"," ","Reviewed October 18, 2017 ","Best Place to Eat and Witness Cultural Dance","A friend recommended me to go there and eat Crocodile Meat :) So I went there to try their Croc Meat Sisig... To my surprise, it taste great especially together with a mug of beer :) Plus there is a bonus, the Fire Dancers did a world class performance when I went there :)"
"familyvagary123","Davao City, Philippines","Reviewed September 20, 2017 ","The most Amazing Fire Show Ever!","The Fire Dance choreography is the best here. We like the tricks and the surprises during the dance. They were able to make a green flame that is exceptional. I've never seen it before. We're glad we came here. The restaurant offers native Filipino cuisine plus the steaks made of crocodile or ostrich meat. Entrance to this place is free when you buy tickets at crocodile park."
"HanaCarrera","Pangasinan, Philippines","Reviewed April 17, 2017 ","Exceptional fire dance, average food!","I went here with my sister because I've heard positive reviews about their fire dance performance (I heard that they also performed cultural dance presentations but we didn't get to witness that on the day of our visit, which was a Friday)! The entrance fee for the show was included in our Crocodile Park ticket (Php 250.00, inclusive of entrance to the Butterfly House, too). The reviews weren't wrong because it was amazing! It was unique, spectacular, and well-executed! The only thing that peeved was that the show did not start on time (supposed to have started at 5:45, but it was 35 minutes delayed).  My sister and I ate dinner while watching the show. The food was quite average. We intended to order the news-worthy ""sungka meal"" but were very disappointed when the waiter informed us that they stopped serving it a long time ago. So we ended up ordering calamari, pork sinigang (Php 160.00), lechon kawali (Php 240.00). The serving sizes were too small (good for 2 or less), and the taste and presentation were common.  To put it simply: stay for the show, not the food."

"nprila"," ","Reviewed June 19, 2016 ","Lunch before visiting crocodile farm","Food was good. Place is colorful - I can see Mindanao. They have the sungka meal but since we are only 2 adults and a kid, we didn't order it. I think the main attraction is their band which plays during the night, so I suggest go there during dinner."

"wildlfower777","Al Ain, United Arab Emirates","Reviewed February 25, 2016 ","Mindanao Cultural Heirtage Within Your Reach","The place is housed inside the famous Crocodile Park which is very accessible by Taxi Ride within the city of Davao. The place showcases a typical native house and its environment which serves native foods cooked the native way during evenings. There is also a regular show in the evening featuring ethnic dances and dramas performed by trained artists complete with authentic costumes and props.
